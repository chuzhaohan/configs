* Outstanding questions:
   - [ ] What does change in S_slope do?
   - [ ] What about change in S_shelf?
   - [ ] Diagnose non-dim paramters once eddy center crosses slopebreak
   - [X] Does the addition of friction change fluxes? - YES
   - [X] Are the frictional cyclones filled with shelf or slope water? - SHELF
   - [ ] Do I expect the water to be dragged from closer to the shelfbreak with friction?
   - [ ] What is the relation between the eddy velocity scale and it's trajectory viz.,
     loopiness.
   - [ ] ew-25

** transport calculation issues?
   - [ ] what do I do about all the secondary cyclones in the domain?
   - [ ] Why is there a non-zero volume of exported shelf water in the beginning?
   - [ ] Why does the exported shelf water volume decrease later on?
   - [ ] non-zero fluxes at t=0?

* topoeddy runs
** Addition of linear drag
   - I see creation of cyclones even when no cyclones were created in the
   inviscid run.
   - Magnitude of rdrg doesn't change diagnostics by too much
   - Amount of eddy water on shelf is a lot smaller but other water mass diagnostics
     are very similar
   - Fluxes are smaller when compared to inviscid runs by about half
   - the inviscid runs manages to pull water that is farther away from the shelfbreak
     when compared to the runs with drag. This is surprising

** Variation in Rossby Number
*** Does Ro affect penetration?
   It's hard to see if Ro makes a difference in the level to which eddies get closer.
   For Ro < 0.1 (ew-04, ew-03), ew-03 gets closer. But once you form cyclones, then
   the track gets "sinusoidal" and tends to get closer with each bump.

*** Does Ro affect fluxes?
    Yes! higher Ro leads to higher fluxes as expected.

** Variation in slope burger number

* Formation of cyclones
** Dewar & Hogg hydraulic jump
  No evidence of this yet.
  runs.tempvelsec will plot near bottom along-shelf velocity and overlay
  temperature contours. I don't see the compression neck that they do.

** Stretching of shelf water
  Definitely see cyclones formed with shelf water. Vertical extent of cyclones
  seems to be about shelfbreak depth. I haven't verified that vortex stretching is
  really why these cyclones are formed. Integrated vorticity budget to shelfbreak depth
  is probably the most reasonable way of doing this.

** Friction
   They contain shelf water.

   
* Committee meeting outline
   * Numerical issues
     - Show free-surface OBC problem (1 plot)
     - vertical velocity noise problem
       - solved by increasing vertical resolution and
       - mixing along s-surfaces required because noise is 8-10 dx in horizontal
         so mixing along geopotential will not solve the problem.
       - show before / after plot
         
   * What do I do about eddy vertical structure?
     - plot showing vertical scale v/s time for one run with
       topo and other with flat bottom
     - show comparison of line W cruise data to baroclinic mode structure
       
   * Describe parameters that I've varied
     Ro, slope burger number, depth of shelfbreak
     
   * 2 videos of cross-shelf dye and vorticity
     - run1 = without shelf-water cyclone formation
     - run2 = with shelf-water cyclone formation
     - Things to point out
       - complicated evolution on beta plane = lots of secondary eddies
       - formation of shelfwater cyclones
       - export of eddy water onto shelf

   * What causes cyclone formation?
     - Stretching of shelfwater
       - deep shelfbreak, large Ro eddy
     - Bottom friction

   * Vorticity budget for 2 runs (with and w/o bottom friction)
     illustrating contribution of stretching and bottom friction
     to cyclonic vorticity generation. (2 plots)
     Maybe a map of bottom friction contribution to vorticity budget, right
     when cyclone is formed? (1 plot)
   
   * Discuss scaling the bottom boundary condition and the parameter in
     LaCasce(1998)

   * Plot average transport as function of Ro, slope burger number, shelfbreak.
     First two are grouped in LaCasce(1998) parameter. (2 subplots)

   * Where is the shelfwater extracted from for the above parameters? Implications of
     having no background velocity? (2 subplots)

   * Export of eddy water onto the shelf and formation of
     barotropic anticyclones (2-3 plots)
     - haven't looked at this in much detail, so just illustrate that it's happening

   * How close does the eddy get to the shelfbreak?
     Plot average isobath location of eddy center near the end.
     Again, show variation with parameters. ( 2 plots)

   * Goals for the next 6 months
     - complete runs without shelfbreak front
     - List parameters still to be varied
       shelf slope, eddy dia/slope width etc.
     - First paper
       - Interaction of eddies with topography
       - aim to explain what controls the exchange of eddy and shelf/slope waters
         across the shelfbreak.
     - hopefully poster at AGU fall meeting.
