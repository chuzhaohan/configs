* Science Questions / Hypotheses / Ideas

1.  Steve says no one has tried to relate interannual variability in
    shelf water properties to number of ring interactions in a year...
    Seems like a good thing to follow up on.

2.  "Where does a ring need to be to draw off shelf water? How can we
    lay out criteria to do a count of these for the MAB over 10s of
    years?" - Ken

3.  Compare results for a stationary ring (for time $\approx$ lifetime
    near shelf for WCR) v/s a moving ring?

4.  Is there a 'steady' (transport = constant) state for a translating
    ring? shows that transport initial increases linearly for a
    stationary eddy.

5.  Where is the water extracted from i.e., how far in cross-shelf
    co-ordinate and from what water depth? How does this vary with
    stratification? What is the partition of exchange / flux between the
    following water classes: shelf, slope, eddy and offshore? How far
    offshore does the shelf water go \citep{Cenedese2013}? shows that in
    a barotropic stationary simulation, this is what is most affected by
    eddy size / strength.

6.  There are questions regarding mixing. How long is shelf water
    identifiable within slope water? How often is shelf water entrained
    into the center of the eddy?

7.  What is the surface signature (SSH/SST/SSS) of the interaction
    events? Can this be quantified in relation to eddy characteristics?
    Does it always exist? Note: "Tang et al. (1985) and Churchill et al.
    (1986) found that shelf water streamers do not always have a surface
    signature, and the three-dimensional subsurface streamers could
    represent a significant term in the mass budget." -
    \cite{Cenedese2013}

8.  Find a paper that does a volume budget for the MAB. Look through
    satellite images for that year and use previously obtained scalings
    to figure out what the eddy driven flux would be and see if it fits
    in with estimate. Look at Ken's deep sea exhcnage ... review and
    Lentz (2008) & Lentz (2010).

9.  I could also look at interaction of a translating eddy with slope
    and the induced circulation. What is the fate of the vortex after
    encountering the shelfbreak front \citep{Cenedese2013}? This would
    be compared with the results of , , etc. A related question is how
    does the bottom trapped along-shore jet associated with the eddy
    interaction interact with the shelfbreak jet? Also, how effective is
    the upwelling within the cyclones generated on WCR impact (see and
    ).

10. Various related questions might be answered based on this: nutrient
    fluxes driven by eddy interactions etc.

11. How is the exchange flux affected by presence of a shelfbreak
    front/current? describe frontal waves possibly generated by
    interaction of the WCR with the current. These waves were seen to
    move in a direction opposite to that expected by previous results.
    No idea why.

* Modelling Approach

-  Creating the eddy :: Allowing a flow to go unstable will complicate
   things. Approximate eddy as being cyclostrophically balanced? Things
   to think about:

   -  Barotropic Gaussian vortices (e.g. ) are weakly barotropically
      unstable.

   -  Use existing eddy stability criteria? Linear stability does not
      seem to work well based on or introduction.

   -  Are WCRs in geostrophic balance? No, gradient wind!

   -  Most observed rings have a core in solid-body rotation.

   Attempt to create a compensated eddy (compensated below what depth?),
   possibly with the core in solid-body rotation. Not sure if WCRs are
   in solid body rotation. Evidence exists for Aghulas warm rings and
   Gulf Stream cold rings. Use data from 1980's WCR expts and the
   Oleander project (1999,
   [[http://www.po.gso.uri.edu/rafos/research/ole/]]).

-  Moving the eddy :: Need a /barotropic/ background flow or β
   (topographic / specify variation in $f$). The results of show that
   using β could complicate things. Results (on a β plane) of suggest
   that the WCR should move northward after impacting the shelf. Thus,
   in the real ocean, the WCRs are probably being advected by a
   background flow.

-  Domain Size :: Based on size of eddy and how large a shelf area it
   draws water from

-  Tracers :: Need salinity since that seems to work best when trying
   distinguish shelf / slope water.

   Use three artifical conserved tracers, the initial values of which
   will be initial $(x,y,z)$ position of the water parcel. This will
   allow inference of where the water is being drawn from. This can also
   be used to come up with 'Lagrangian float' tracks (find where
   particle with initial ($x_0,y_0,z_0$) is at every time step).

-  Boundary Conditions :: Probably use a periodic setup with a restoring
   section at the edges. Need to talk to Mike Spall about this.

Start off with a barotropic simulation of an eddy translating parallel
to a step.

Find out how long I can maintain the eddy?

Since shelf water parcels must stretch when pulled offshore, I could use
cyclonic vorticty as a 'tracer' for shelf water.

* What I need to learn from literature

1. What are the differences b/w shelf, slope, WCR and offshore waters?
   Is a slope really required? i.e., are there substantial differences
   b/w slope water and the water just offshore? Alternatively, is a
   shelf/non-shelf distinction good enough?

2. What is the cross-shelf nutrient distribution associated with the
   above classes of water? This should tell me what exchanges are
   biologically important.

3. What does the surface signature of interaction events look like in
   SSH / SSS / SST?

4. Would a barotropic simulation represent a lower or upper bound on
   fluxes?

5. Characteristics of WCRs:

   -  What is the width of the continental slope and how does WCR radii
      compare to this?

   -  What is the mechanism for WCR motion - β or advection? What is
      their typical translational velocity and what would be a typical β
      required to acheive this? - advection!

   -  How barotropic / surface intensified are they? - exist to about
      1-2km depth

   -  What is the monthly distribution of number of events? =
      climatology?

   -  How close do they get to the shelfbreak?

   -  How long do they 'live' near the shelfbreak?

   -  Are they in geostrophic / cyclogeostrophic balance or in
      solid-body rotation? - latter

   -  What is their 'typical' motion like? - south-westward

   -  Is there some seasonal cycle to the existence of WCR / streamers?

   -  Why do they not penetrate over the shelf?

   -  Are they big enough to feel β? If so, what is the effect of β on
      large rings? - self advection and disturbance of circular symmetry

   -  Radius / $L_D$ = ?

6. What physical region should I focus on (based on best observations)?
   George's Bank? The shelfbreak south of New England? Loop current
   eddies in the Gulf of Mexico? Brazil current eddies have been studied
   a lot?

* Preparation

** WCR tracks

shows that most center tracks are between the 2000 & 3000 m isobaths.
Mean vel. fields from \cite{Flagg2006} () show that alongshore flow
(always > 0) is SW along-isobath. Cross-isobath flow,interstingly shows
a strong onshore component between 200 & 300 km (to 400 m depth). This
is between the 1500 & 3000 m isobaths, approximately. This signal varies
seasonally - onshore flow during winter & "an offshore bias" during
early fall \citep{Flagg2006}.

Does this mean that WCRs are pushed against the shelf as they move
parallel to it driven by alongshore flow?

** Outcrop and Foot

Looks like the front outcrops 40-80 km offshore of the shelfbreak. This
is based on the climatologies - table 1, fig 12 in \cite{Linder1998} and
figures in \cite{Zhang2011}.

* Diagnostic Calculations

** Eddy Tracking & Scales

I use the methodology in \cite{Chelton2011}. Easily implemented using
MATLAB's image processing toolbox. Added some modifications (limits are
empirically set for 1,2):

1. Solidity < 0.90 : ratio of region area to area of convex hull. This
   eliminates thin filaments and isthumuses since they contribute little
   to actual area but a lot to convex hull area.

2. Rectangularity < 0.85 : defined as ratio of region area to area of
   rectangular bounding box. This removes the rectangular features it
   picks up sometimes due to the search region mask.

3. Obuko Weiss parameter : abandoned since it doesn't help much but the
   code is in there.

*** Eddy Vertical Scale

+The analytic profile initially is+
$$T(z) = (T_0+az)\left( 1 + e^{-\left(\frac zH\right)^2}\right) \qquad a = T_z = \frac{N^2}{gα}$$

+$a$ is the linear stratification and $H$ is the vertical scale I'm
after.+

+I seem to get better results if I subtract the "background
stratification" (vertical profile at inflow boundary = $T_0(1+az)$).
Thus, as of now (May 15, 2013), I'm fitting to $T_0 \exp{(-z/H)^2}$ -
gaussfit2 - which isn't the above. I get a lower scale than what I had
put in but /vertical scale decreases with time as expected/. If I fit
for the linear trend too (after subtracting background,
$(T_0 + az)exp(-(z/H)^2)$ - gaussfit3 - then /vertical scale
increases!/+

Now, I fit to the sine curve and it works well.
$$T = T_0\left(\frac{1+\sin{\left(-k/4*z + θ_0\right)}}{2}\right) \qquad, \; L_z = 2π/k$$

Update: I now do a Gaussian fit, the fit seems to work even if the shape
is truncated significantly.

*** Eddy 3D structure

Find $δρ$ at surface corresponding to the zero vorticity contour. This
works pretty well (see in ).

[[images/rhothresh.png]] [fig:eddy3d]

** Frontal Properties

These definitions are based on \cite{Linder1998} &
\cite{Fratantoni2001},

1. Horizontal scale (front.hscale) = distance between $v_{\text{max}}/2$
   locations (onshore,offshore)

2. Vertical scale (front.vscale) = height at which $v=v_{\text{max}}/2$.

** Streamer transports

Using floats:

-  I could define tracer as floats per grid cell (or some sort of bin)
   diagnostic = trajectory concentration in \cite{Doos2007}.

-  Define some criteria to identify streamer / offshore transport. Then,
   use float position to identify "streamer grid cells" and calculate
   transport associated with these cells. Alternatively, I could define
   a convex hull formed by these identified floats and use that as a
   "streamer mask". Then I get all properties of the streamer. The
   advantage to using a convex hull is that I need fewer floats but I'll
   be depending on the floats to sample at leat the extremes of the
   streamer.

   -  Initial location will be useful.

   -  Some floats are advected in circles by the eddy. This is easily
      seen as oscillatory time series in float's $(x,y)$ position. I'll
      need some way to remove that. This should remove floats that are
      detected with the next criterion. Alternatively use $(r,θ)$
      co-ordinate system with eddy center as origin.

   -  Remove floats that are within the eddy contour and mark those as
      unapplicable for future. times.

Why floats and not tracer?

1. The eddy strains the tracer field resulting in small gradients that
   will dissipate. This means that I will potentially overestimate
   transport that occurs if I use a passive tracer as an identifier.
   But, there must be similar mixing happening in the real ocean. Hmm...

2. \cite{Cervantes2003} reasoning?

3. Comparing the passive tracer field with velocity vectors shows that
   passive tracer needs to be reset at regular intervals for it to be
   useful. NOT CORRECT, SEE BELOW.

Things I have learnt

1. Do not use dye = 1 over shelf etc. because the usefulness of that
   depends on you knowing /a priori/ where you need the dye to be.
   Better to use lagrangian labels.

*** $(r,θ)$ filtering of floats

*Ken pointed out that this is the same as throwing out floats once they
cross a certain longitude w.r.t eddy center. Eulerian v/s Lagrangian
viewpoints - former is a lot easier to explain and implement.*

Figure is a good example of a float getting stuck in the eddy and then
getting kicked out.

1. Use -180 to 180 transition to figure when I should start tracking -
   using $\Delta θ > \SI{350}{\degree}$.

2. then look for absolute (change in angle) = ?

[[images/float-track-theta.png]] [fig:fltheta]

** Accounting for shelfbreak front instability

Paritition domain into 2 regions: up- and down-stream of eddy's initial
location and make two assumptions:

1. Upstream region is uninfluenced by eddy-front interaction and the
   instability there is presumably statistically the same as a run with
   front & no eddy (as long as upstream region is long enough?). I can
   check this with two runs and comparing cross-shelf eddy transports
   for upstream region (run with eddy) and whole domain (run without
   eddy).

2. Assume that cross-shore transport in the downstream region is a
   linear superposition of instability transport & eddy induced
   transport. To check the validity of this, I could compare offshore
   transports across the front up & down stream of eddy and see what
   happens?

** Non-dimensional parameters

*** Bathymetry

$$\begin{aligned}
    H_\text{sh} &= \text{Minimum depth of shelf} \\
    s          &= \text{slopes of shelf / slope} \\
    Z          &= \text{max.\ depth in domain} \\
    S_\text{sl}  &= \text{Shelf Burger number} = s_{\text{shelf}}\frac{N}{f_0}   \\
    S_\text{sl}  &= \text{Slope Burger number} = s_{\text{slope}}\frac{N}{f_0}\end{aligned}$$

*** Eddy

Variables are

$$\begin{aligned}
    (V_r,R,H_e) &= \text{eddy (max.\ azmiuthal vel., radius of max.\ vel, vertical scale)} \\
    \alpha &= \text{TCOEF} \\\end{aligned}$$

Note that $H = Z/2$ with BC1 vertical structure and so is dependent on
$S_{sl},  S_{sh}, H_{sh}$.

Scaling the gradient wind balance equation gives
$$\Ro^2 + \Ro = -\frac{\alpha g Z T_\text{amp}}{f^2 R^2}$$ The last term
can be a Burger number \citep{Olson1991}

Parameters are

$$\begin{aligned}
    \Ro &= \text{eddy Rossby number} = \frac{V_r}{f_0 R} \\
    \mathit{Rh} &= \text{eddy Rhines number} = \frac{V_r}{βR^2} \\
    \Bu &= \text{Eddy Burger number} = \left(\frac{f_0 R}{NZ}\right)^2 \\
    \mathit{Bu}_{\text{temp}} &= \text{? Burger number} = \frac{\alpha g Z T_\text{amp}}{f_0^2 R^2} \\
    \Ri &= \text{Eddy Richardson number} = \frac{N^2}{\left( \alpha g T_\text{amp}/f_0R \right)^2}\end{aligned}$$

* Numerics

** Eddy profile

The $z$ profile function is specified either as

1. a normalized (1 at surface) half-Gaussian - this leads to only one
   parameter and a well-defined vertical scale for the eddy.
   $$F(z) = \exp\left[- \left(\frac{z}{H}\right)^2 \right]$$

2. First baroclinic mode structure with barotropic component such that
   velocity = 0 at bottom. $θ_0$ is the surface anomaly (SQG mode) that
   I set to 0 for now (07 Aug 2013).
   $$F(z) = \frac 12 \left[ 1 + \sin \left\{ \frac{(H/2-z)}{H} \cdot π + \left( θ_0 -\frac π2 \right) \right\} \right]$$
   There can be some confusion for $θ_0$ because she uses a sine
   function instead of cosine. Essentially, phase at z=0 is $\pi/2$ when
   there is no surface anomaly. Her reply said $θ_0 = 7/16 * \pi$ and
   their choice of function is $\sin{(k*z + θ_0)}$. Hence, for my
   version must be $\sin(π/2 + k*z + φ_0), φ_0 = θ_0 - π/2$.

The radial profile is specified using either

1. the \cite{Katsman2003} expressions for /Gaussian/ (α = 2),
   $$T(r,z) = T_{\text{amp}} F(z) \exp\left\{ -\frac{α - 1}{α} \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^α\right\}$$

2. the \cite{Katsman2003} expressions for /Solid Body Rotation/
   $$T(r,z) = T_\text{amp} F(z)$$

3. or \cite{Zhang2013} expression
   $$T(r,z) = T_{\text{amp}} F(z) \left( 1-\frac{r_n^2}{2} \right) \exp{\left(\frac{-r_n^2}{2} \right)} \qquad , r_n = \frac{r}{r_0}$$
   For this, max velocity & max. counter-rotating velocity should be at
   (/assuming geostrophy/ - works for latter, not so well for former)
   $$\frac{r}{r_0} = \sqrt{\frac 72 ± \frac{\sqrt{33}}{2}} = 0.792\; | \; 2.524$$
   Correcting for gradient wind balance looks a bit complicated and not
   really worth the effort. Limit of influence is approximately
   $r = 4.4 r_0$. See

[[images/zhangeddy.png]] [fig:zhangeddy]

Compare (2) and (3) in .

[[images/compare-eddystruct.png]] [fig:eddystruct]

To choose $r_0$, I need to use the deformation radius. Since I'm using
linear stratification, $$r_0 =  L_R = \frac{NH}{\pi f}$$

I then calculate the velocity field that balances this using either

1. /Geostrophic Balance/

   Equation of motion for azimuthal velocity in an axisymmetric flow:
   $\left(u_θ = r\dd θt\right)$
   $$\frac{u_θ^2}{r} + fu_θ = \frac{-1}{ρ_0} \pp pr$$

   Thermal wind balance in radial co-ordinates:

   $$\begin{aligned}
    \pp{u_θ}z &= \frac{α g}{f} \pp Tr \\
    \pp{u_r}z &= -\frac{α g}{f} \frac 1r \pp Tθ\end{aligned}$$

   This does not work well.

   For the general profile $T(r,z) = T_{\text{amp}} R(r)F(z)$, we have
   the following (geostrophic) relations

   $$\begin{aligned}
       \text{Geostrophic velocity shear} \qquad v_z &= \frac{α g}{f} T_{\text{amp}} F(z) \pp Rr \\
       \eta (r) &= αT_{\text{amp}}\bigintsss_{-H}^{0}F(z) \dr z \bigintsss_{0}^{r}\pp Rr \dr r \\
                &= α \bigintsss_{-H}^{0}\left[ T(r,z) - T(0,z) \right] \dr z\end{aligned}$$

   So,
   $$v = \frac{αg}{f_0} T_\text{amp} R'(r) \int_z^0 F(z) \dr z + C(r)$$
   Imposing, $v=0$ at $z= -H$
   $$v = - \frac{αg}{f_0} T_\text{amp} R'(r) \int_{-H}^z F(z) \dr z$$
   Instead, imposing $v = v_s r_0 R'(r)$ at $z=0$ (integrating down from
   surface)
   $$v = v_s r_0 R'(r) + \frac{αg}{f_0} T_\text{amp} R'(r) \int_z^0 F(z) \dr z$$
   This is associated with free-surface field
   $$η = \frac gf v_s r_0 R(r)$$

2. /Gradient Wind Balance/

   Let $v = u_θ = r dθ/dt$. For steady, axisymmetric flows, the equation
   of motion is
   $$\frac{v^2}{r} + f{v} = \frac{1}{ρ_0} \pp pr = fv_{\text{geo}}$$

   The solution to the quadratic is the gradient wind,
   $$v_{\text{gra}} = \frac{rf}{2}\left[ -1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{4v_{\text{geo}}}{rf}} \right]$$

   For anticyclones, $v_{\text{geo}} < 0$. Thus, for real solutions,
   $$|v_\text{geo}| < \frac{rf}{4}$$

   \cite{Olson1991} shows that all WCRs are in this parameter range
   viz., $\Ro \le 0.25$.

The interesting thing is that now everything depends on total water
depth, which means everything is a function of the shelf and slope
Burger numbers. Radius and vertical scale are all dependent on Z. The
velocity magnitude is also dependent on Z since we're integrating the
shear vertically (depends on vertical scale!). So essentially, I can
adjust Z and $T_\text{amp}$ to get through parameter space = good!

\cite{Joyce1985} calculates local $\Ro = \zeta/f$ and shows values >
0.25 - I see this in my initial condition. This is because the condition
is on /geostrophic/ velocity! Also, note that salinity compensates for
temperature in these rings = I shouldn't take $T_\text{amp}$ values from
temperature sections. For e.g. in (Fig. 4 in \cite{Joyce1984a}), the
$\rho$ gradient is
$\SI{5}{\kg/\m^3}/\SI{75}{km} \approx \SI{0.4}{\degree}$C.

[[images/joyce1984.png]] [fig:joyce84]

*** Expressions for energy

Given a Gaussian profile
$$T = T_\text{amp} \exp{\left[ - \left(\frac{x}{L_x}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{y}{L_y}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{z}{L_z}\right)^2 \right]}$$

** Shelfbreak Front

*Initial Condition*
How do I address the density compensating nature of the front i.e.,
allow both $T,S$ variations and control frontal slope? How do I get the
front in the right location?

-  $T$ seems to have a sharper gradient near the shelfbreak

-  $S$ has weaker (compared to $T$) gradient near shelfbreak

Seems like I need *two* length scales describing T,S gradient around the
shelfbreak - max gradient ($T,S,σ_θ$) seems to be at shelfbreak always
at least for the MAB. Since this is a linear EOS, maybe I can relate the
density frontal slope to these length scales and magnitude of the $T,S$
gradient. Or maybe I should calculate the frontal slope on my own?

Ken suggests that I can avoid this by using salinity only to define the
shelfbreak front & temperature only to define the eddy structure. That
gives me 2 tracers that will be easy to visualize. Since, I use a linear
EOS, all I need to make sure is that the density contrasts across the
front are in the realistic range. I think I should use salinity to build
the background state and the shelfbreak front since that will allow me
to use 'salinity classes' to classify transport. But, will my salinity
classes make sense when interpreting it using real world observations?
It seems like I'll have to deal with density classes when interpreting
output.

The algorithm I use to create the front is as follows

1. First, find where the shelfbreak is by looking for water of max.
   shelf depth.

2. +Between (sbreak-Lleft) and (sbreak-Lright), make+
   $$\sout{T_x = T_{x0} \; \mathrm{sech}^2\left( \frac{x - x_0}{\text{scale/5}}\right)}$$

   +and $T_x=0$ else where. Scale = Lleft + Lright. $x_0$ is the center
   of the front which changes as a sloping line in the vertical plane =
   frontal slope. The factor of 5 is to make the gradient over a smaller
   scale so that grid stretching doesn't affect the front as little as
   possible.+

3. I set the tracer field, $T$, as ($x_{\text{sb}},h_{\text{sb}}$ are
   cross-shore location and water depth at shelfbreak)

   $$\begin{aligned}
   T &= \frac{ΔT}{2} \cdot \tanh{ \left\{ \frac{x - \left( x_{\text{sb}} + \frac{z-h_{\text{sb}}}{\text{slope}} \right)}{L_x}\right \}} \cdot \exp{\left\{{-\left( \frac{z}{L_z}\right)^2}\right\}} \\
   T &= T - \text{min}(T)\end{aligned}$$

   The last step is done to make sure that the anomaly is always
   positive and that the magnitude of jump across front is dT (1+tanh
   wouldn't work - need to account for exponential).

   There is one unexpected consequence to the addition of vertical
   scale. Since I need velocity to go from 0 to 1 to 0 smoothly = $T_x$
   is of same sign = I need $T$ to go from 0 to 1 across the front and
   stay as 1 (like $\tanh$). I cannot have $x$ variation in the $z$
   profile as that essentially introduces another gradient, ergo, I am
   messing around with stratification.

Once, frontal structure is determined, I use geostrophic balance to get
FS and velocity field. There seems to be good evidence that the
shelfbreak front is mostly in geostrophic balance. +I need to be careful
calculating the pressure gradient when figuring out the velocity field.
This will require implementation of ROMS' prsgrd32.f file. + Now trying
analytical form for $v$.

*Note that frontal slope is slope of the isopycnal gradient, NOT the
isopycnal. The isopycnal slope is used to approximate frontal slope from
observations by assuming one particular isopycnal represents the frontal
slope.*

*Maintaining the front*

Some ideas:

-  restoring in the interior = ugh

-  set properties at inflow? = Nud / Cla

-  No flux = Gra BC works?

-  Use rivers or maybe slow boundary inflow at coast.

*Large scale questions*

-  How do I fix my horizontal gradient calculation?
   It looks like this might need implementation of higher order methods
   similar to that used to fix PGF error in ROMS.

-  Need to control the noise near the outflow boundary. Sponge layer +
   front? Do I just use a momentum sponge?
   The sponge layer works well with Gradient boundary conditions.

** Boundary Conditions

*No shelfbreak front: *Using FS = Cha & T,S = Gra seems to improve
behaviour at the downstream boundary. /Note that \cite{Zhang2011} used
FS = Cha, T,S = rad and ubar,vbar = Fla at the offshore boundary in
their model. The alongshelf downstream boundary is periodic (2D
simulation)/

Nudging timescales of 5-10 days seem to do alright, don't see much
difference but I haven't looked at it in detail.

*With shelfbreak front:* I need a sponge layer at the outflow boundary
(with above LBCs) to kill noise there. Using large timesteps results in
noise at the inflow boundary too. Ken suggested putting a sponge at the
offshore boundary to kill off any internal waves and make the setup
cleaner.

FS = Rad & T,S = Gra at downstream boundary. u,T,S = RadNud, FS = Che at
inflow.

** $w$ field

here's an email to Ken

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Yes, I agree that the domain has to be bigger. I think I'll increase
  the sponge width too - hopefully that will kill more waves coming in
  from the north eastern corner.

  The vertical velocity field with the harmonic sponge is a lot cleaner
  (see images in /home/dcherian/wmovie-visc2). Remember that increasing
  the biharmonic viscosity much more in the sponge requires that reduce
  my timestep by a lot. Do you think I should just use harmonic
  viscosity since it is so much cleaner? I'm convinced that standing
  wave pattern is the byproduct of a not-strong enough sponge near the
  open boundary.

  The cross-hairs still exists on the $f$-plane and in the 750m
  resolution run. So, I'm not sure why it exists.

  The colored patch that starts later (2 dx stuff) is indeed 2dx. I see
  it in the f-plane run too, which means it probably doesn't coincide
  with the eddy crossing isobaths. Interestingly, the location of the
  2dx stuff is near the end of the continental slope. I see it in the
  runs with harmonic viscosity too. It just starts later. I don't see
  any effects of it in the other fields.

* Analysis Notes

** Questions

1. What happens to offshore water that gets onto shelf? Does it get
   pushed off later? or does it mix in?

2. How does the eddy spin off a smaller eddy over the shelf? What
   parameter range?

3. Why is there upwelling when the eddy hits the slope?

4. What is causing the near shelfbreak upwelling and downwelling when
   the eddy gets near?

** Eddy evolution

** Flat bottom evolution

It looks all the runs on a flat bottom have a tendency to split apart
and form dipoles. The latter happens with smaller vertical scales. Only,
742-nobg with $fl/NH \sim 1$, seems to do this before interacting with
topo. Might have to do with growth rates.

Now, \cite{Flierl1988} puts forward criterion for stability of
"isolated" vortices. Apparently vortices with too small of an "outer"
(annular) region leads to elliptical mode growth and dipole formation.
This might be what I'm seeing. To test this, I'm doing a run with a
wider annular region.

** Wodon properties

From \cite{Shi1994}

1. Along-wall translation speed decreases with increasing size.

2. 

*** Twisting instability

\cite{LaCasce1998} sees it also and points out that \cite{Flierl1988}
says that a ring of oppositely signed vorticity surrounding the core is
required for the instability. It also requires a barotropic component,
which I do have. I need to compare growth rates.

Fig. 7 of \cite{LaCasce1998} shows a lower layer PV pattern that looks
similar to the Rossby radiation field I see in my runs.

*** Over the slope

*At what isobath does the eddy stop?*

Two approaches: One is to look at the bottom boundary condition.
Presumably non-linear terms help the eddy cross more isobaths and will
stop when the relative importance of these terms drops.

[sec:flierl] Other approach is to follow \cite{Flierl1987} and do an
integrated balance. Turns out Glenn has already done this. Essentially
there must be enough bottom pressure torque to balance the
$\beta$-force. This gives a scaling for /eddy vertical scale:/ where
$U_b$ is the bottom velocity scale and $U$ is the eddy velocity scale.
$$D \sim \frac{\alpha f_0}{\beta} \frac{U_b}{U}$$ I'm assuming that the
bottom pressure scales with geostrophically balanced velocity, $U_b$.
This doesn't take into account

Some concerns about why this might not work:

-  Choosing a domain big enough to contain enough features but still be
   meaningful enough to call the eddy? Essentially, the stream function
   Ψ should decay fast enough and my domain should contain enough space
   for it to do so.

-  There might be "boundary contributions" to the integrals. This is
   connected to the above.

*Old Stuff:*

From \cite{LaCasce1998}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  So long as the vortex is not expressible as a sum of topographic wave
  modes, which is the case if it is surface intensified or barotropic,
  one always expects a surface vortex to be "left over" after wave
  radiation.
#+END_QUOTE

Let's assume that WCRs are a perfect sum of vertical modes in the deep
ocean \citep{Zhang2013}. Then, over a given slope, I must figure out how
much of this structure maps onto the topographic wave modes. Subtract
the two and that should give me a structure for what the residual eddy
must look like over topography and more importantly, a vertical scale
that should be compared to isobath.

Step 1: What do topographic waves over a steep slope look like?

1. Using =animate_pt= output, it looks like the eddy pushes away
   existing shelf water and is a pretty coherent structure over the
   slope.

2. I need to understand the origin of the cyclonic structure to the east
   of the eddy. It is responsible for pulling off a good chunk of slope
   water.

3. Vormask tracks eddy dye pretty well. See =animate_pt= output.

** Water mass budgets

For linearly stratified simulations, I can define /five/ water masses

1. Offshore water : y\_slopebreak < y-dye

2. Slope Water : y\_shelfbreak < y-dye < y\_slopebreak

3. Shelf Water : y-dye < y\_shelfbreak

4. Eddy Water : eddy dye > 0.7 or something

5. "Mixed Water": 0.01 < eddy dye <= 0.7 . The lower limit is required
   for floating point comparision.

I care about these water masses in 3 different regions

1. Deep ocean : y\_slopebreak < y

2. Slope sea : y\_shelfbreak < y <= y\_slopebreak

3. Shelf : y <= y\_shelfbreak

=runs.water_census= implements this classification. There are weird
things like , where at $t=1$, the diagnostic says there's
$\mO(\SI{1e10}{m^3})$ (runew-06-big) of offshore water on the slope.
Similar error exists for slope water on shelf. But total volume adds up
extremely well - error = $\mO(\SI{15}{m^3})$.

[[images/offslwater.png]] [fig:offslwater]

** Effect of friction

=ew-04, ew-540, ew-541, ew-542= have =rdrg= 0, 1e-3, 5e-3, 1e-2=. With
non-zero friction, I see generation of cyclones - seen in "curvy" eddy
center track. However, with eddy diagnostics it's hard to tell the
difference between non-zero rdrg values. Surprisingly, all of them get
equally close to the shelfbreak.

** Comparison against flat-bottom runs

You don't see the eddy move away from the vertical coastal wall in a
flat bottom run but you see it do so when there's a slope. Note that
\cite{Dewar2010} consider vortices that have a subsurface maximum (at
half the water column depth).

For ew-03 and ew-03-flat, I really can't tell the difference in vertical
scale evolution or in the eddy diagnostics. This is when I scale time
the same way in both cases which is reasonable.

Now, I think I should see only the lower half of the "compression shock"
pattern that \cite{Dewar2010} see in their results since my eddy is a
surface intensified anomaly unlike theirs.

** The cold streamer

*** Flux parameterization

Maximum flux:

-  Using eddy velocity scale (since max flux is when eddy straddles
   shelfbreak) * depth of shelfbreak * lmaj (for width of streamer),
   results in an overestimate by 1-2 orders of magnitude.

-  csflux.shelfxt/bathy.hsb gives an estimate of depth-averaged velocity
   that is ≅ run.eddy.V/10. Reading ubar, vbar agrees with the previous
   estimate. So, using the eddy velocity scale is an overestimate by a
   factor of 10. I expected the eddy velocity scale to be a good
   estimate since max flux is when the eddy straddles the shelfbreak.
   Time to see if this is correct. Well, it's clearly wrong: .

-  Maybe it's a better idea to assume an approximate form for the decay
   away from the eddy like saying the eddy decays as a exponential or
   Gaussian away from the 0 vorticity contour. Then I get a sense for
   velocity magnitude at the shelfbreak.

-  Using the transport=10% of max transport as time when eddy velocity
   and lmaj is chosen works slightly better than eddy center over topo.
   Only runs ew-45 and ew-15 are outliers. See first attempt in .

[[images/max-flux-param-try1.png]] [fig:max-flux-1]

*** Identification

1. 
2. +Defining 'thalweg' section - Approach 1+

   1. Take eddy center and make a radius matrix. Multiple this by
      streamer mask. Do some additional processing to throw out stuff
      south (maybe east is better?) of eddy center - find mean radius of
      the remaining 'streamer' and use that radius to construct a
      circular path = thalweg.

*** Properties

1. There is definitely more 'streamer' at surface than depth. How do I
   visualize / quantify it? OK - quantify using centroid of z-dye in
   streamer?

2. A lot of the water gets back to original isobath. I can see this by
   visualizing streamer.contour. There are zeros when the streamer moves
   back onslope which means that $\Delta y$ for parcels in the streamer
   is < 5 km. I should quantify /net offshore transport of water for
   various isobaths/

*** Upwelling in the streamer?

How can I answer this?

1. Identify streamer with criterion and integrate vertical velocity in
   it. Using this method, the prominent feature is a downwelling region
   near the north-west corner of the eddy. This would make sense with
   water columns getting stretched as they are pulled offshore?

2. Should be some way to use dye i.e., identify streamer with
   cross-shelf dye and then calculate moments of z dye values in the
   streamer. /This is complicated because of the BL adjustment that
   happens./

** Streamer cyclones

=runew-05= definitely shows secondary cyclones being formed from shelf
water. vertical extent of the cyclone is 10m smaller that shelfbreak
depth (50m)

** z-dye

1. First look at z-dye. There is a drop in mean z-dye value at the
   surface which indicates upwelling everywhere at least in the top
   40-50m (offshore)! /High TKE\_min problem!!! this is now fixed./ This
   looks like a boundary condition thing.

   Let's solve analytically! Stationary system + boundary condition
   $$\pp Ct = A_v \pp[2]Cz \; ; \; \pp Cz = 0, z=0,-H$$ The solution is
   $$C(z,t) = \Sigma_{n=1}^\infty A_n \cos\left(\frac{n\pi z}{H}\right) \exp{\left(-A_v \left(\frac{n\pi}{H}\right)^2 t\right)}$$
   $A_n$ is determined by initial condition but more importantly the
   timescale is most determined by the $n=1$ mode and so,
   $$t \sim \frac{H^2}{\pi^2 A_v}$$ So, deep water takes longer to
   equilibrate. Getting a length scale to this is tricky since it
   changes with time. +Should be possible to estimate numerically. But
   the real question is, how do I deal with it? Subtract out a mean?+

2. There is pronounced upwelling within the eddy, especially once it
   hits the slope. Verified with AKt problem fixed.

3. There is also near-shelfbreak up/downwelling on the east/west sides
   of the eddy. Verified with AKt problem fixed.

4. The streamer is /not/ readily apparent in the z-dye field - at least
   at preliminary examination.

** Warm streamer

*** Vortices over the shelf?

The eddy seems to be leaking negative relative vorticity i.e., from the
core on to the shelf as a sheet which then rolls up to form vortices.
See from =runew-06-spall-const-5d-4-shc=. The vortices and the sheet has
a depth-averaged component, so that might be a good place to start
figuring out what you need for rollup to happen. +My hypothesis is that
you need some minimum flux of vorticity. This flux is greater when the
shelfbreak is deeper, since you can push more volume and hence,
vorticity on the shelf. You can get a sheet, and not a blob, because the
vortex is moving and because there's a background flow. I should do a no
background flow run to test this. The sheet then rolls up and forms
vortices.+

Better hypothesis is that the streamer forms a mostly barotropic
alongshore jet that is then barotropically unstable, resulting in wave
then eddies. Looking at rvor plots shows that the gradient is strong and
I have only 6 points across it, so I'm not resolving it very well.
/However, if it was barotropically unstable, then there should be wave
development visible. and a well defined wavelength rather than vortex --
vortex sheet -- vortex pattern/

I think the correct explanation is that vorticity is episodically
exported from the vortex core. This corresponds to points when the south
edge of the vortex core crosses the shelfbreak as it's spins around.
This has a certain periodicity to it. It's like a tap being turned on
and off - export a lot, then a little with a decreasing amplitude
modulation .

Questions that need to be answered:

1. What is the structure of the vorticity filaments on the shelf before
   they roll up? Are they barotropic? What is the major component of
   vorticity in these filaments?

2. How similar is the evolution to that over a flat bottom?

   A: Very similar. There are similar flashes of export of vorticity
   from the eddy core. It looks a lot more violent and there are
   stronger cyclones shed.

** Along-shelfbreak jet

This jet is not really a jet as I was thinking of it. It is a blob of
(mostly) single-signed negative vorticity that I think is going unstable
resulting in a bunch of eddies.

Looking at output, I see
$$A = \frac{α_\text{iso}}{α_\text{bot}} \sim \Ro = \frac{U}{fL_x}$$

So, a scale for pressure, $[p]$, doesn't seem very obvious right now.

Since $λ,ν$ are at most $\mO(1)$ and $\Ro, A < 1$, this suggests that
$u$ *at the bottom* is geostrophically balanced *unless*
$ν^2 \sim \Ro/A$. Using *hydrostatic balance* gives a scale for $ρ$
$$p \sim [p] = fUL_y ρ_0 ⇒ ρ \sim [ρ] = \frac{fUL_yρ_0}{gD}$$

Applying these scales to the *bottom boundary condition* --- :

$$\begin{aligned}
{5}
\frac{1}{fT} \,ρ_t &\,+\,& \Ro \,uρ_x &\,+\,& \frac{ν\Ro}{λ} \,vρ_y &\,+\,& \frac{ν\Ro}{A} \,h_y vρ_z &\,-\,& α_\text{bot} V \frac{ρ_0}{fg[ρ]}N^2  \,h_y v &= 0\end{aligned}$$

Using the scaling for $[ρ]$

$$\begin{aligned}
α_\text{bot} V \frac{ρ_0}{fg[ρ]}N^2 &= α_\text{bot} V \frac{ρ_0gD}{fgfUL_yρ_0}N^2 = α_\text{bot} \frac VU \frac{D}{L_y}\frac{N^2}{f^2} = α_\text{bot} ν \frac{L_x}{D}\frac{L_x}{L_y}\frac{N^2D^2}{f^2L_x^2} = \frac{ν}{Aλ} \frac{ND}{fL_x}\end{aligned}$$

Then, becomes

$$\frac{1}{fT} \,ρ_t \,+\, \Ro \,uρ_x \,+\, \frac{ν\Ro}{λ} \,vρ_y \,+\, \frac{ν\Ro}{A} \,h_y vρ_z \,-\, \frac{ν\Bu}{Aλ} \,h_y v  = 0
\label{eq:pebbcscl2}$$

Right now, I see that $\Ro \sim 0.5$

--------------

To summarize, the scaled continuity, x-momentum, y-momentum and bottom
boundary condition equations are (with $\frac{1}{fT} \sim \Rot$):

I could say
$$\frac{ND}{fL_x} \sim 1 ⇒ \frac 1A = α_{\text{bot}} \frac{L_x}{D} \sim S_α$$

in which case, (what does the above mean in terms of my other scaling
parameters?) +But this implies that thermo balance is
$ρ_t + wρ_{0z} = 0$, while my reasoning to date has $ρ_t ≪ wρ_{0z}$ so
that $v ~ 0 $+ - Ken says the $fL/N$ is more general and should come out
of the fully Ertel PV equation too.

--------------

The last two choices are more realistic. In both cases, it's hard to
conclude much except that the bottom slope term is as important as the
non-linear terms, if not more, meaning that at some level the eddy is
adjusting to the presence of a vertical wall - which I do see.

** Scaling for the Taylor Proudman theorem

The key pieces seem to be:

-  $w_z \sim 0$ or $u_x \sim v_y$ in the continuity equation

-  $w=0$ at the surface - rigid lid approximation = not bad at mesoscale

-  Steady flow or $\Ro_T = (fT)^{-1}$ is very small.

Take the scaled thermo equation

$$\Ro_T ρ_t + \Ro (uρ_x + vρ_y) + \frac{W}{fD} wρ_z + \frac{WN_0^2}{f}\frac{ρ_0}{g[ρ]} N^2w = 0
\label{eq:thermoTP}$$

with
$$\Ro_T \sim \frac{1}{fT} \; ; \; \Ro = \frac{U}{fL_x} \; ; \; \frac{U}{L_x} \sim \frac{V}{L_y} ≫ \frac{W}{D}$$

Along-shelf velocity is generally in geostrophic balance. So, we use
thermal wind balance for along-shore velocity to get a scale for
density: $$\frac{g}{ρ_0}[ρ] \sim \frac{fUL_y}{D}$$ Then,

$$\frac{WN_0^2}{f}\frac{ρ_0}{g[ρ]} = \frac{WN_0^2}{f}\frac{D}{fUL_y} = \frac WU \frac{N_0^2 D^2}{f^2L_y^2}\frac{L_y}{D} = \frac{W/D}{U/L_x} \frac{L_y}{L_x} \Bu$$

So, becomes

$$\Ro_T ρ_t + \Ro (uρ_x + vρ_y) + \frac{W}{fD} wρ_z + \frac{W/D}{U/L_x} \frac{L_y}{L_x} \Bu \; N^2w = 0$$

*** Stratified Taylor column literature

\cite{Hogg1973} says that Talor column will form when the height of a
/cylindrical/ obstacle exceeds
$$h_c = \frac{2HfLU_\text{rms}^2}{U_\text{bot}}$$

** Inertial boundary current

Use the steady state barotropic qgpve $$J(ψ,q) = 0 ⇒ ∇²ψ - βy = K(ψ)$$

Impose a flow (streamfunction) at $y=y_0$ = shelfbreak
$$Ψ_0 = ψ(x,y_0) = e^{-x^2/2} \; ; \;\;\; x ≡ \frac{x^*}{L_0}$$ So,

$$\begin{aligned}
    ∇²Ψ_0 - βy_0 &= K(Ψ_0) \\
    (x²-1)Ψ_0 - βy_0 &= K(Ψ_0) \\
    (-2\ln{Ψ_0}-1)ψ - βy_0 &= K(Ψ_0) \\
⇒ K(ψ) = -ψ(1+2\ln{ψ}) &- βy_0 \addtocounter{equation}{1}\tag{\theequation}\end{aligned}$$

The governing equation becomes

$$\begin{aligned}
    ∇²ψ - βy &= -ψ(1+2\ln{ψ}) - βy_0 \\
    ∇²ψ + ψ (1+2\ln{ψ}) &- β(y - y_0) = 0 \addtocounter{equation}{1}\tag{\theequation}\end{aligned}$$

Which seems ridiculously hard.

With a piecewise linear (or quadratic) forcing, I get
$$K(ψ) = \text{constant}$$ where the RHS is constant /regardless/ of $ψ$
resulting in $$∇²ψ - βy = C$$

** Eddy penetration over slope

Here's the question I need to answer: Given an eddy with scales $L, D$,
and it moves across the slope, which of the following (when the rest is
held constant) controls where it stops moving cross-slope:

-  Rossby number of the eddy, $\Ro$

-  Slope Burger number, $S_α$ - i.e., topographic radiation away from
   the eddy controls penetration

-  Water depth at eddy center, $H/D$ - i.e., does the eddy always stop
   at a particular non-dimensional isobath - i.e., think of the eddy as
   a solid coherent core that doesn't radiate away

-  That the eddy's edge reaches the shelfbreak which is too shallow
   compared to the eddy depth $H{_\text{sb}}/D ≪ 1$

*** Varying Ro

[[images/Rh3.png]] [fig:ro-tracks-a]

[[images/Rh12.png]] [fig:ro-tracks-b]

Figures [fig:ro-tracks-a] and [fig:ro-tracks-b] shows that when $\Rh$ is
maintained constant, $\Ro$ has no influence on the initial behvaiour of
the eddy over the slope. There are differences later in the runs but
this evolution is a function of the vorticity exported off the shelf,
which increases with increasing $\Ro$. So, the pattern seen in is due to
the differences in initial $\Rh$ of the eddy. For lower $\Rh$, the
initial eddy loses more of its horizontal and vertical structure and
gets closer to the shelfbreak.

*** Vary slope Burger number $S_α$

[[images/Sl-04-tracks.pdf]] [fig:sl04]

In , we see changing $S_α$ by a factor of 2 still results in the eddy
center being approximately one deformation radius away from the
shelfbreak.

/However, this is for low values of $\Ro / S_{_\text{sl}}$/. and , show
that there eddies can be prevented from getting to the shelfbreak and it
looks like $\Ro / S_{_\text{sl}}$ might be the controlling parameter.
+However, I have not ruled out that increased radiation due to low $\Rh$
is not the cause.+

Now, (), +it looks like for $\Rh = 12$, all tracks seem to converge at
long time. However, there is a trend in where the cross-isobath motion
is arrested at short times.+ These figures are normalized by initial
distance from shelfbreak. THEY ARE NOT CORRECT.

[[images/Sl-all.png]] [fig:sl-all]

*** Does the eddy always stop at a particular non-dimensional isobath

To check this, I changed the width of the continental slope keeping the
slope Burger number fixed at 1.5 and the shelfbreak depth fixed at 50m.
Keeping the eddies at deformation scale size results in , where again,
the eddy center gets to one deformation radius away from the shelfbreak.

[[images/34-penetration-slope-width.png]] [fig:334-tracks]

What is the water depth 1 deformation radius away from the shelfbreak?

Assume, water depth
$h(y) = H{_\text{sb}}+ α{_\text{bot}}(y-y{_\text{sb}})$ for
$y > y{_\text{sb}}$. Let $L_D = NH/πf$ be deformation radius for max
water depth, H and $D = fL_D/N = H/π$ Then

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{h(y{_\text{sb}}+ L_D)}{D} &= \frac{H{_\text{sb}}+ α{_\text{bot}}L_D}{D} \\
             &= \frac{H{_\text{sb}}}{D} + α{_\text{bot}}\frac{NH}{πfD} \\
             &= \frac{H{_\text{sb}}}{D} + S_α\end{aligned}$$

*** Depth of shelfbreak

** Integrated momentum balance

1. "Wave drag" is probably a bad term. Pressure force on the material
   surface is the better way to think about it, I think. So,
   $$\text{Pressure force = Planetary lift + bottom pressure + wave drag}$$

   where, wave drag is due to pressure fluctuations at the material
   boundary of the eddy.

2. Essentially the $\pp{}{y}\int p + p_1 s_{1x} - p_0 s_{0x}$ term is
   integrated pressure force on the material surfaces.

3. If there was no sloping bottom, you get a "planetary lift" force
   \citep{Nof1985} which is always to the /left of the motion along
   background PV contour/. This is a side pressure force. He has a good
   way of visualizing it by imagining a cylinder moving through β plane
   ocean. Switch reference frame, and since this should be in QG
   balance, it means the interface slopes (and heights) are different on
   the left and right of the eddy, resulting in a sideways pressure
   force. /Motion meridional to the PV contour does not experience a
   lift force./

4. In my (idealized) case the sloping bottom cuts through the material
   boundary of the eddy. Then you have a combination of this sideways
   pressure force and bottom pressure anomaly acting on the eddy.

5. Something about dropping the $\pp{}{y} \int p$ is wrong if I think
   about an eddy, i.e., integrate only to the edge of the eddy rather
   than to ∞ as in \cite{Flierl1987}. Or, when integrating to ∞, the
   side pressure force on the eddy and the reaction onto the flow end up
   cancelling out?

6. \cite{Warner2009} calls integral of bottom pressure times bottom
   slope as "form drag"

OK. Brain wave today. In \cite{Flierl1984}, he finds that the "steady"
solution is one where the net wave drag is directed eastwards (opposing
westward motion) and this can only be opposed by the Coriolis force on a
southward moving eddy. So, /net motion is south-westward but wave drag
is directed eastwards/ i.e., wave drag has no meridional component in
that case.

[[images/force-diagram.pdf]] [fig:fbd]

*** Integrated angular momentum theorem for 2 layer system

Start with (slope in $y$) $$\pp{q_i}{t} + J(ψ_i, q_i) + β_i ψ_{ix} = 0$$
where $$q_i = ∇^2ψ_i + F_i\left(ψ_{3-i} - ψ_i\right)$$

Multiplying by $x$ for each layer gets messy because the form
stress-like terms remain. You get more insight by summing the two
equations and then muiplying by $x$ and domain integrating. Assume that
$F_1 = F_2$ $$q_1 + q_2 = ∇^2(ψ_1 + ψ_2)$$ The Jacobian terms too
simplify

$$\begin{aligned}
 J(ψ_1,q_1) + J(ψ_2, q_2) &= J(ψ_1,∇^2ψ_1) + FJ(ψ_1, ψ_2-ψ_1) + J(ψ_2,∇^2ψ_2) + FJ(ψ_2, ψ_1-ψ_2) \\
&= J(ψ_1,∇^2ψ_1) + J(ψ_2,∇^2ψ_2)\end{aligned}$$

Then, we get
$$\sum_{i=1,2} \pp{∇^2ψ_i}{t} + J(ψ_i, ∇^2ψ_i) + β_i ψ_{ix} = 0$$ Using
the arguments for a single layer in \cite{Flierl1983}, this reduces to
$$β_1 \iint ψ_1 + β_2 \iint ψ_2 = 0$$ where, $β_1 = β, β_2 = β + β_t$.
In \cite{LaCasce1998}, $β_1 = β = 0, β_2 = β_t$, then,
$$β_2 \iint ψ_2 = 0$$

So when there is lower layer signal, his eddy should always radiate
waves. For small $\frac{U}{β_2L^2}$ (steep slope), he sees wave
radiation and for large $\frac{U}{β_2L^2}$ (gentle slope), he sees the
lower layer and upper layer acting like an eddy on a β plane - i.e., the
vorticity argument makes sense. So, the Rhines-like number is an
additional constraint on behaviour.

If the slope was in $x$ instead of $y$, then you get two conditions (as
in the continuously stratified case)
$$β_1 \iint ψ_1 = 0; \quad β_t \iint ψ_2 = 0$$

To get here multiply by $x$ and $y$ separately and integrate. The two
conditions should come in at same order in the wave signal problem -
which makes sense since it drops out of the integrated momentum
equations without any further work. So, in this case, you must always
radiate.

Explaining \cite{Jacob2002} -
$β_t \sim \SI{2.5e-11}{};  β \sim \SI{2e-11}{}$, Rhines numbers in both
layers $\sim 20$. In all cases, the eddy will radiate. But in some cases
it radiates more than others.

1. Northern coast (B3): decays faster than with southern coast (B4),
   moves southwestwards.

2. Southern coast (B4): decays slower and moves mostly westwards. -
   Lower layer Rhines number is very large since
   $β_2 = β - |β_t| \sim \SI{0.5e-11}{m^{-1}s^{-1}} → \Rh_2 \sim 80$.
   For $β_t ≫ β$, you can get motion to topographic west, which agrees
   with \cite{LaCasce1998} (for high $\Rh$).

3. Does a bunch of experiments with southern coast where you can make
   the eddy go south or north based on value of $β_t$.

4. Weirdly, with a western coast, the eddy loses energy quicker than
   with an eastern coast.

In both cases, Rhines numbers are high and the eddy must radiate waves,
but trajectories are very different when integrated over same amount of
time.

When $F_1 ≠ F_2$, the derivation is unclear; but \cite{Flierl1994}
derives the theorem for the fully non-linear two layer system. e gets
$$β ⟨Ψ⟩ = - ⟨p'_2 ∇H⟩; \quad Ψ = H_1ψ_1 + H_2ψ_2$$ The qg (only in lower
layer) version of this is
$$βH_1⟨ψ_1⟩ + \left( β + β_t \right) H_2⟨ψ_2⟩ = 0$$

*** Idealized eddy

For a density anomaly
$$ρ = ρ_a \exp\left[ - \left(\frac{x}{L_x}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{y}{L_y}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{z}{L_z}\right)^2\right]$$

This just ends up being a constant and predicts a bottom slope 1-2
orders of magnitude too small.

*** V/Vb

Plotting $V/V_b$ doesn't work so well, because $V_b$ is hard to get
unambiguously. Is it wave or eddy?

But assuming Gaussian structure at all times gives me a useful
prediction.

For EW isobaths, the momentum equation gives me useful info. This
doesn't tell me anything about the zonal motion of the eddy, just the
meridional motion.

Some relations:

$$\begin{aligned}
   \iint x \pp fx &= \iint \pp{xf}{x} -  f \\
\\
   \iint x^2 \pp fx &= \iint x \pp{xf}{x} -  xf \\
                    &= \iint \pp{x^2f}{x} - 2xf 
\\
   \iint x \pp[2] fx &= \iint x \pp{f_x}{x} \\
                     &= \iint \pp{xf_x}{x} - f_x \\
\\
   \iint x^2 \pp[2]fx &= \iint x x\pp[2] fx \\
                     &= \iint x\pp{xf_x}{x} - xf_x \\
                     &= \iint \pp{x^2f_x}{x} - 2xf_x \\
                     &= \iint \pp{x^2f_x}{x} - 2\pp{xf}{x} + 2f\end{aligned}$$

*** Direct area integrals of momentum equation

I'm having some success by choosing contours that make $\iiint u = 0 $
and $\iint \pp{}{y}\int p = 0$. however, I get a negative pressure
anomaly developing near the end when the eddy is close enough. This
results in bottom torque dropping from a value when it balances
integrated angular momentum really well. But the eddy's energy decay
rate doesn't change, not does it's cross-isobath velocity.

There are a few options.

1. There is enough positive pressure anomaly around the eddy that is
   being excluded by my contour to compensate for this decrease. This
   could be due to the leakage. Hard to tell. The leakage has very low
   bottom pressure anomaly, some slightly positive, some slightly
   negative.

2. Integrated angular momentum is decreasing too. This would make sense
   if I accounted for the leakage / jet (positive $u$, negative $y$
   w.r.t the eddy center).

3. $c \iint fh$ accounts for the difference. Also not possible. This
   term is 3 orders of magnitude too small. There is a drastic increase
   in westward velocity though. =mvx= doubles aligning very well with
   =traj.tind=.

4. There might be a free-surface contribution to form torque but that
   should be really small.

5. My interpretation that "lesser imbalance" means lesser wave radiation
   is wrong. Not correct. In fact, I see greater $dE/dt$ when the bottom
   torque starts decreasing.

Some issues with the calculation

-  Sometimes area averaging works better =ew-6371= but not in others
   =ew-64361=.

-  With gentler slopes, there is large enough signal over topography to
   make it look like bottom torque is large enough earlier than needed.

** Energy / Mass Loss from the eddy

Presumably, there are three ways the eddy loses energy

-  Planetary Rossby wave radiation

-  Topographic Rossby wave radiation

-  Leakage from the core of the eddy

-  I don't know how a potential instability of the eddy would fit in
   here.

The idea is to understand how long it takes my eddies to decay. How fast
does energy decay in the eddy, over the flat bottom and over topography?

*Hypothesis:* Loss of eddy energy corresponds to loss of vertical
structure which makes it easier for the eddy to cross isobaths. But, the
rate of energy loss seems to be dependent on the shape of the eddy and
the wave radiation field that results from it's evolution.

Glenn's work seems to show that unless very specific conditions are
satisfied, the eddy will always radiate energy into a wave field. The
equation for the barotropic wave field turns out to be the equation for
waves over topography $h$, where in those papers, $h$ is the shape of
the upper layer interface over a flat bottom. The properties of the wave
field might change over a sloping bottom, but it should still radiate
energy. This says that the eddy will continuously lose energy and slowly
spin down, continuously moving across isobaths as a result.

I see that $\dd Et$ is reduced by about $½$ over the slope as compared
to over the flat bottom - . The big spike in $\dd Et$ for =ew-36= is
when a big chunk of eddy splits off. =locate_resistance= picks out a
location just before that peak, so the splitting occurs right when the
meridional translation velocity is reduced significantly.

I expect to see effects of energy loss in

1. Vertical scale

2. Volume

3. KE, PE

4. Cross-isobath velocity scale

Comparing =ew-6342= and =ew-6362= show that lower $\Ro$ eddies cross
isobaths at a lower speed and lose vertical structure less quickly. Now,
the forcing in all of this is $β$. +So, I could start with $β$ forces
the eddy to move southwards across isobaths, the eddies evolution is an
/effect/ of this.+ \cite{Flierl1984a} points out that really, these two
effects are coupled, so this is not the right way to think about it.
But, I can use one as a proxy for the other. This seems to work a *lot*
better for runs over gentler slopes. The scatter plot is encouraging ,
at least for runs over gentle slopes.

[[images/ew36-dEdt.png]] [[images/ew6342-dEdt.png]] [fig:dEdt]

[[images/ew34-dEdt-scatter.png]] [[images/ew6342-dEdt-scatter.png]]
[fig:dEdt-scatter]

Diagnosing all of these is hard. I have best chance of calculating the
last one but it's hard because of eddy dye flux due to filamentation on
the $β$ plane and the choice of an ideal location is not obvious.

*** Wave radiation and meridional motion

\cite{Flierl1984, Flierl1984a, Flierl1994} are confusing me.

Somehow, there is an equivalence between southward translation and form
drag on the eddy. I can see that when the wave field is large enough,
there is large enough form drag at the interface that the eddy's
translation velocities are modified. The rate at which energy is
transferred to the radiation field, is also determined by the form drag?
Cause and effect here are really unclear to me.

\cite{Flierl1994} says

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Once such north-south motion is established [initially], apparently,
  the rapid westward translation of the warm eddies is not enough to
  eliminate wave production.
#+END_QUOTE

I think this says that the westward velocity is not large enough to be
super-critical w.r.t the Rossby wave mode, and so, the eddy still
radiates waves. But not sure.

Essentially, if the eddy moves faster than the first baroclinic wave, it
can't lose energy to it. It can, however, lose energy barotropically. In
fact, apparently, the eddy /always/ loses energy to the barotropic mode.
\cite{Flierl1984} says that the barotropic mode shows a wake structure
to the east of the ring. Not sure why? This is because the eddy moves
away from the wake. The wake is /not/ radiating to the east.

Large eddies ($\sim$ 2.5 times deformation radius) will be non-radiating
\citep{Flierl1984}. As long as waves are possible, I think the wave drag
is always in the same direction, since energy is always being taken away
from the eddy.

*Question:* With the leakage, does the eddy speed up enough that it is
super-critical? Looks like this happens for =ew-34,35,37=. Not for
=ew-36= or =ew-6xxx=, except =ew-6371=. In terms of volume loss, =37= >
=6371= > =6372=, and speed-up changes too, so I think I'm seeing
speed-up caused by leakage. Before this, /all these eddies are moving
westward slower than the long-wave phase speed of the undisturbed
medium./

\cite{Flierl1994} has a prediction for meridional velocity of centroid
($V$ is eddy velocity scale)
$$v_{c}^{y} \sim \frac{\text{eddy depth}}{\text{depth of rest of water}} \cdot V$$

OK. Eddy's =cvy= is always 0.07-0.08$\times$ eddy velocity scale.
Exception is =runew-64361=.

*** Energy fluxes

Been working on calculating energy fluxes in a domain bounded by the
shelfbreak and sponge layer edges. I see an oscillatory pattern with
energy fluxed into and out of both boundaries. This is weird, I think.
The good news is the energy flux (in $y$) across and the northern sponge
layer is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the rest. I need some
wavelength averaging to figure out actual fluxes.

My other issue is stuff that isn't being killed by the sponge: and . It
looks like stuff is moving westwards out of the sponge and that
intensity decreases as it exits the eastern sponge.

[[images/ew04-sponge-asflux.png]] [fig:spasflux]

[[images/ew04-sponge-csflux.png]] [fig:spcsflux]

*** Energy in the eddy

"Observations":

1. Volume averaged KE increases at later times, coinciding with an
   increase in eddy $\Ro$.

2. Volume integrated KE, PE just decrease with time. BUT, see below.

3. When normalized by initial value, d(volume integrated KE, PE)/dt
   seems to change when eddy crosses slope. A similar, but weaker,
   signal exists for volume. . But this change occurs right at
   =traj.tind=. So, I think it's all being controlled by evolution over
   the flat bottom. The problem is that since some of these runs start
   partially over the slope.

4. It looks like when the eddy is over the slope, I have energy leaving
   the domain both to the east and west of the eddy i.e., in both long
   planetary Rossby wave and CTW directions. So, the energy radiation in
   deep water is a little hard to deal with, but I can look at energy
   radiated over the slope associated with eddy water and not.

On :

When normalized by initial value, d(volume integrated KE, PE)/dt seems
to change when eddy crosses slope. A similar, but weaker, signal exists
for volume. . But this change occurs right at =traj.tind=. So, I think
it's all being controlled by evolution over the flat bottom. The problem
is that since some of these runs start partially over the slope.

The major outlier is =ew-64361= where I bumped up $\Rh$ to 60.

[[images/E.png]] [fig:E]

Interesting observations:

1. As $\Ro$ ↑, $|∂E/∂t|$ ↑ for both KE and PE; i.e., energy decay :
   =6362 > 6372 > 6342= and =6371 > 6341=. This makes more sense in
   light of (3). As, $\Ro$ ↑, I increase β so that $\Rh$ stays constant.

2. I have roughly 3 clusters.

3. There is more correlation with $β/β_t$ than any of the other
   variables. OK. $βL/f_0$ is better. . =64361= is the only outlier.
   It's the only with $\Rh = 60$. Scratch that, =ew-3*= all don't agree
   with the scaling. See (5)

4. With runs that start partially over a slope, I see lesser $|∂E/∂t|$

5. Plotting against $βL_z - αf_0 (1 - \erf{(H_\text{edge}/L_z)})$,
   results in better collapse for $∂PE/∂t$ but crap for $∂KE/∂t$. The
   motivation for this is that wave field should be proportional to
   $β∫∫ψ - αp_\text{bot}$. Trying $ΔPE$ is slightly better but $ΔKE$ is
   total crap. (I'm ignoring a factor of $U_s L_x L_y^2$ here.)

\cite{McDonald1998a} claims that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In the case of anticyclones, which drift westward faster than all
  possible Rossby wave phase speeds, the exterior field is evanescent
  and steady solutions are possible. This is not so for cyclones,
  because they drift westward at a speed which matches an available
  Rossby wave phase speed
#+END_QUOTE

But when comparing my diagnosed center-of-mass velocity with long Rossby
wave speed ($βL_D^2$), radiation of Rossby waves is possible. This is
probably because the \cite{Cushman-Roisin1990} paper cited by
\cite{McDonald1998a} derives a velocity formula for low $\Ro$ eddies.
However, \cite{Flierl1994} makes the same prediction with a much more
non-linear model. Funny.

*** Comparision with flat bottom runs

How does KE change with change in vertical scale ($h$) for a Gaussian?

$$\begin{aligned}
\pp{KE}{h} &\sim \pp{}{h} \int_{-∞}^0 u^2 \, dz \sim  \int_{-∞}^0  u \pp uh \, dz \\
u &\sim \int_{-∞}^z u_z \,dz \sim \int_{-∞}^z T_x dz \\
  &\sim \int_{-∞}^z e^{-(z/h)^2} dz\end{aligned}$$

This gets too complicated.

** Glenn's two layer qg model

From \cite{LaCasce2000}, (pg.1313), conserved total energy is
$$\sum_k \sum_l H_1 \text{KE}_1 + H_2 + \text{KE}_2 + H_1 \text{PE}$$
where
$$\text{KE}_i = κ^2|\hat{ψ}_i(k,l)|^2 ; \quad \text{PE} = F_1 |\hat{ψ}_1 - \hat{ψ}_2|^2$$

When layer depths are equal

1. $V_1 = - V_2$ still results in wave radiation, but very slow compared
   to $V_1 ≠0, V_2 = 0$.

2. Adding a slope in $x$ seems to result in faster radiation,
   $\Rh = 16$.

The \cite{Jacob2002} eddy has maximum velocities

$$\begin{aligned}
 V_1 &\sim \frac{g η_0}{fR_\text{max}} e^{-1/2} \\
 V_2 &\sim \frac{g'h_0}{fR_\text{max}} e^{-1/2} (R-1) \\
 \frac{V_2}{V_1} &\sim \frac{R-1}{R}\end{aligned}$$

** Eddy crossing shelfbreak?

There are a couple of ways to frame this question.

1. Given an eddy vertical scale and shelfbreak depth, how much of the
   eddy volume gets onto the shelf?

   When the eddy essentially splits into much smaller eddies, this is a
   more "flux-like" question.

2. Say that shelf width (i.e., presence of a coastal wall) is not a
   factor. Does the eddy split across the shelfbreak or not? Does it
   split into 2 equal halves? Does it split into a number of smaller
   eddies?

3. Compare the volume lost in each split to that lost in interaction
   with a vertical wall.

4. How far onto the shelf can this eddy volume penetrate?

* Modelling Progress

** Folder Structure

1. sbeddy = shelfbreak front + eddy

2. topoeddy = topography + eddy (could have mean flow).

3. shelfbreak = runs to test front creation

4. oldeddy = \cite{Katsman2003} profile.

** General Plan

1. Figure out some 2 layer equivalence. +Integrate from -Z to -Z/2 &
   -Z/2 to surface?+

2. Multiple vertical modes and appropriate horizontal structure.

3. Compare final vertical scale of eddy / isobath depth with vertical
   scale of surface mode for that slope.

4. \cite{Magaldi2011} & \cite{Harden2014} comparison - shows transport
   from pretty far inshore of shelfbreak

5. Do experiment with flat bottom to check image effect hypothesis and
   velocities.

6. Float stuff

7. +Statistics with Castelao dataset.+

8. What is causing that strong velocity jump at the eastern edge of the
   eddy? Is the smoothing of this front over the slope due to CTW
   activity? Is this what starts the along-isobath jet that Ken saw in
   his linear paper?

** Notes before Leaving

-  Check run with periodic & sponge

-  Figure out how the rel vort anomaly near shelfbreak is created - how
   much water is actually moving offshore?

-  Cross-sectional plots of $w$ show that noise is confined to slope -
   why so?

** Numerical Problems encountered

1. Bad sponge code - fixed by outputting visc2\_r etc.

2. Viscosity timescales

3. OBC noise - seen in east-north sponge runs at western (inflow)
   boundary. Killed by introducing base viscosity. Now I use west sponge
   to kill this. OBC noise was later seen to trigger instability
   (described below)

4. Numerical instability seen where vertical grid spacing is maximum -
   $\Delta z = 50$ seems to be threshold. Which means I need 60 points
   in 2000m water. Controlling =hc= seems to be the key. This is fixed
   with improv2 stretching and even old stretching with 60 points. ADD
   IMPROV3

5. Barotropic / zeta wave craziness - not sure yet.

6. High frequency FS oscillations with stretching = [1,1,500] . *NOT*
   fixed by setting /inflow/ FSOBC = Rad. *Old stretching doesn't have
   it.* This is definitely a stretching problem. With non-constant
   $N^2$, increase vertical resolution where $N^2$ is larger.

7. Grid scale noise at shelfbreak throughout depth (i.e., visible at
   surface also), due to eddy concentrating gradients? Effects seen in
   all fields. First noticed in dye and relative vorticity. Non-zero
   diffusivity fixes this.

8. Rossby waves radiating from open eastern boundary. The signal is not
   seen in $w$ but is seen in $v$. It exists in eddy + topo, eddy + flat
   bottom but not in plain flat bottom runs. So, I think it is forced by
   the eddy. But it starts right at the beginning of the run, so it
   /isn't/ forced by short Rossby waves from the eddy.

** Vertical stretching

Key =

1. old = [3,3,100,40]

2. improv1 = [3,1.5,500,50/60]

3. improv2 = [1,1,500,60]

4. improv3 = [3,3,500,60]

* Notes

** 12 May 2015

-  Working on runs with significant barotropic signal over the slope
   just realized that I can use the /same/ eddy and topography and
   /only/ change β!

-  I think =locate_resistance= is the way to go...

** 11 May 2015

-  Image effect runs are also weird. Change in volume doesn't seem to
   agree with change in velocity. I should calculate how much momentum
   exits the eddy.

-  I'm playing around with using =fit_traj= and =locate_resistance= for
   diagnostic with parameterization . Looks a *lot* better than . When
   using the tanh fit, the problem is that you're not looking for a
   consistent slowdown. When looking for consistent slowdown, problem is
   that it is sensitive to smoothing.

[[images/paper1/penetration-erf-param.pdf]] [fig:tanh]

** 05 May 2015

-  =ew-b362= gets to shelf when I expected it not to.

-  The bottom friction runs, on the other hand, get stopped further away
   than =ew-6341= which is weird.

** 27 Apr 2015

-  Trying to estimate scatter for erf parameterization. Error in fitting
   y-traj increases for longer integration! because the linear trend at
   the end might be too hard to get.

** 21,22 Apr 2015

-  =ew-6352= is similar to =ew-6452=. They're both outliers (even though
   the latter had $\Rh=10$ and the former had $\Rh = 12$), so something
   else is weird.

-  My calcualtion of total energy in the 2-layer QG runs shows energy
   increasing with time. That's really weird.

-  =ns-6441= ($\Rh=65, L \sim L_\text{def}$) doesn't get to the
   shelfbreak just like =ns-64361=
   ($\Rh=65, L \sim 3.5\times L_\text{def}$). So, Rhines number seems
   like the culprit. Note that =ew-6341= gets stopped away.

-  But why is it sensitive to /planetary/ β? I think that for larger β
   you continuously radiate energy from the eddy, meaning it's vertical
   scale decreases - so an effective lower layer Rhines number is small.
   For smaller β, you lose energy to topographic waves till the
   effective lower layer $\Rh$ becomes large enough.

-  So, there's two pieces (as I have suspected) - Can the system become
   quasi-isolated, if not, can it radiate efficiently?

** 17 Apr 2015

-  Doing more shelfbreak depth runs in general...

-  Been thinking about figuring out whether I can define a physically
   meaningful "degree of imbalance". Not getting anywhere. Glenn had
   suggested looking for an "energy-like" equation but not sure what
   that might be. Enstrophy doesn't seem to work (based on Pedlosky
   (1987)).

** 09 Apr 2015

-  $ΔL_z \sim \frac{U}{βL_s^2}$. $L_s$ in particular! for some reason.
   This is from =t=1= to =t=traj.tind=

-  Been thinking about the "eddy crossing shelfbreak" question?

** 05, 06 Apr 2015

-  OK. I'm starting =ns-6441= with $\Rh = 65$ to see if now the 34 eddy
   won't get to shelfbreak.

** 03 Apr 2015

-  WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! =ns-6341= eddy gets to shelfbreak. What is going
   on here?!

   Confirmed. =ns-64361= is stopped away from shelfbreak but still
   closer than =ew-64361=. =ns-6341= is stopped at shelfbreak but
   =ew-6341= isn't.

-  I need to setup more runs tomorrow then.

Met with Joe Pedlosky:

-  Why doesn't the vorticity induction argument over the slope work?
   i.e., why isn't the eddy moving towards topographic south?

-  Suggested starting eddy on the slope with appreciable bottom pressure
   signal to see if vorticity argument works then.

-  Think of lower layer wave properties as flow over mountain on a
   $β$-plane i.e., for a two layer model like that of \cite{Flierl1984},
   the slope is like $β$.

** 01 Apr 2015

-  Force balance with north-south isobaths is weird. The coriolis force
   on a meridionally moving mass is away from slope. The pressure should
   be directed away too (physically). This means that the wave drag must
   act to push it into the slope.

-  Next goal is to understand what direction the wave drag should be in?

** 31 Mar 2015

-  Using =eddy.tscaleind= as initial instant makes =ew-64361-2= look
   like crap. There is a sharp change in vertical scale when the center
   crosses onto the slope - might have to do with large size.

-  =ew-6342, ew-6452, ew-6372= are outliers and I absolutely cannot
   figure why. =ns-64361= is in there too. Some thoughts:

   -  isn't how close these runs are to the shelfbreak. A lot of the
      others are quite close too.

   -  Might not be actual value of slope. 64361 for e.g. has same slope
      but lands nicely.

   -  The behaviour of =ew-6452= is a lot different especially if you
      look at =Lgauss=. It decays a lot faster and keeps decaying. It's
      $\Rh = 10.98$ which is a little bit lower but that's the only lead
      I have now. It behaves like =ew-6362, ew-6362-1, ew-6362-2= all of
      which have high $βL/f$.

-  removing the erf (essentially saying that shear is linear) results in
   better agreement.

** 29 Mar 2015

-  Crap, the NS isobath run stalls out too when Flierl, Stern &
   Whitehead says that it shouldn't. But this means my stuff could be
   more relevant.

-  Massive improvements to tanh fitting. I still haven't figured out why
   the normalization by initial depth works best. Major outliers are
   =ew-6342= and =ew-6452=. If I can fix those two, things will look a
   lot better.

-  +Maybe those two runs are where $y1/y0$ is not small and so, the
   time-scale definition is slightly inaccurate. I should look into it.+
   Actually this doesn't seem to be true.

-  Need to start more NS isobath runs tomorrow. And more cyclone, $N^2$
   and $f<0$ run. Maybe the latter first.

[[images/penetration-erf-param-tanh.png]] [fig:penerf-tanh]

** 26 Mar 2015

-  Phew. Non-constant $N^2$ run (=ew-b4361=) plots right on the line!

-  Sweet, cyclone fits too! (=ew-64351-cyc=).

-  So does =ew-64361-2=

** 24, 25 Mar 2015

-  Using =locate_resistance= instead of =traj.tind=,results in =ew-36=
   not being an outlier in $∂E/∂t$ plot, so that's good.

-  Tried the $x^2, xy, y^2$ moments of the vorticity equation. I don't
   know if it'll work yet. Will have to try tomorrow.

-  Talked to Steve:

   -  Lentz & Fewings review paper (Figure 1) might have some
      interesting observations. Not sure if relevant.

   -  Gone april 14-29 for committee meeting.

   -  What does the intercept mean? In the limit $β → 0$ (f-plane) or
      $α → ∞$ (vertical wall) i.e., $β/β_t → 0$, the hypothesis makes no
      sense. For $α → 0$ (flat bottom) i.e., $β/β_t → ∞$, again no
      sense. So I shouldn't extend the line too far on either side.

   -  Kim's CODAR papers might have interesting observations.

   -  Think about aspect ratios
      $$\frac{β}{β_t} = \frac{βL_x}{f_0} \frac{L_z/L_x}{\pp Hy}$$

** 19, 20 Mar 2015

-  UGH. Silly mistake in parameterization. Assuming Gaussian structure
   at all times gives
   $$1 - \erf\left(\frac{H}{L_z^0}\right) = c \left(\frac{β}{β_t}\right)$$.
   . I think the errors are associated with the structure (here $\erf$)
   I assume.

   NO! The patterns is just my earlier plot of (H/Lz v/s β/βt) but
   inverted. All I'm doing is drawing a straight line through it.

   Actually, that is pretty sensitive to how much I smooth my eddy
   velocity estimate. Updated estimate looks pretty nice . This uses
   =locate_resistance= for water depth. Improvements are my accounting
   for the y-intercept and playing around with smoothing.

-  Parameterizing timescale is a lot harder. It doesn't just scale with
   turnover time.

-  OK. Eddy's =cvy= is always 0.07-0.08$\times$ eddy velocity scale.
   Exception is =runew-64361=.

[fig:penerf]

[[images/penetration-erf-param-old.png]] [fig:penerf-old]

** 17, 18 Mar 2015

-  The issue now is that the dominant balance is geostrophic and I want
   to look at deviations from that.

-  But $\pp{}{y} \int p$ and $p_\text{bot}\pp Hy$ are two big terms that
   cancel out to give a small residual if I choose a contour based on
   angular momentum. $f_0u$ and $p_\text{bot} \pp Hy$ cancel if I choose
   a contour based on $\int p$

-  Izi points out that to get rid of geostrophy, what I should do is
   form the vorticity equation. However, upon doing this and applying
   the assumption of \cite{Flierl1983}, I get nowhere. The $β\int v$ and
   $p_{0x}s_{0y}$ terms both integrate to zero.

-  Ken has said that I should cut my losses and proceed to scaling
   assuming this physics holds.

-  The fit I get is
   $$\frac{H}{L_z^0} = \frac{0.12}{0.025 + 0.16 (β/β_t)^{0.28}}$$. The
   exponential fit is $$\frac{H}{L_z^0} = 1 + 0.9 e^{(β/β_t)/0.029}$$
   Ken says I should use physics to rationalize the form of the fit.

-  Think of the timescale as e-folding time-scale on the trajectory.

-  I think the next course is to change only β on =ew-64361= and get a
   couple more points.

[[images/penetration-param.png]] [fig:penparam]

** 14 Mar 2015

-  I'm comparing $-\int \pp py$ from ROMS diagnostics for =ew-6452= to
   my estimate of $-\pp{}{y} \int p + \pp Hy p_\text{bot}$. They should
   be equal. Things work really well when I subtract out an x-mean (or
   western-most element) from *both* the ROMS diagnostic and my terms.
   This is when I define my pressure anomaly with respect to the
   /initial/ stratification. So I'm missing some mean gradient
   contribution to pressure anomaly (almost certainly associated with
   boundary layer adjustment over the slope).

-  Momentum terms agree really nicely (including the nonlinear ones). I
   had to compare against an appropriately averaged diagnostic quantity
   since I estimate derivatives after having moved to RHO points.

-  OK. Now I have a mean field error for pressure gradient that's single
   signed and is non-zero only over the slope.

-  When I don't subtract out the background field, the calculation works
   well in that worst error is where the slopes are small. Oh madarchod.
   Using the second time instant to estimate background pressure works a
   lot better. This makes my error in prsgrd   , with actual prsgrd
   being about .

-  However, though this increases my confidence in my pressure
   calculation, the momentum budget doesn't really get much better.

** 11,12 Mar 2015

-  negative pbot anomaly starts when density contour associated with
   zero vorticity contour intersects the bottom. =traj.tind=
   approximately corresponds to density contour associated with SSH
   contour intersecting the bottom. Ken thinks that this is totally
   fake. But it's not. Plotting cross-section of full density field
   shows the signal.

-  One idea might be that the greater imbalance later on (once the
   negative anomaly developes) would lead to more meridional propagation
   if not for the shelfbreak. This is not true. =ew-64361= (2x the
   vertical scale) stops far away from the shelfbreak. The only
   complication with that run is that since the eddy's volume flux is
   large, the slope water it moves around become strong enough cyclones
   that the eddy oscillates around. Time-averaging the bottom torque
   term over a turnover time scale results in same result.

-  So, the negative bottom pressure anomaly is robust. The positive
   pressure outside the pressure mask doesn't seem to be enough to
   compensate for it.

-  =ew-64361= has a nice =bottom_torque= plot only when not normalized
   by area. UGH. The opposite holds for =ew-6371=.

** 09 Mar 2015

-  AAAAAAARGH. I made a mistake earlier. I want $βyu$ to be positive and
   need positive bottom pressure anomaly. So the /negative/ anomaly that
   develops later is unexplained.

-  I now estimate the streamfunction field and integrated pressure field
   and use them to define appropriate contours for LHS and RHS. This
   means that the $f_0u$ and $\pp{}{y}\int p$ terms are much, much
   smaller compared to the other two. So that's no excuse any more.

-  This means that I'm trying to make the following equation work
   $$β\iint ψ = α_\text{bot} \iint p_\text{bot}$$

-  With the above, for $S_α$ = 0.5, things work OK. Bottom pressure
   increases when I expect it to but then decreases later on because of
   the negative pressure anomaly developing. For $S_α = 0.25$, there's
   apparently always a large bottom pressure anomaly who's magnitude
   doesn't really change by much.

-  I should look at what the non-linear terms are doing with these new
   contours. Maybe $S_α = 0.25$ with the eddy farther out.

-  At least for =ew-6372=, the =syms_angmom= estimate looks better.
   Hmmm.... I have been assuming that my pressure calculation is
   problematic, maybe it's the streamfunction?

** 03, 04, 05 Mar 2015

-  Much better bottom pressure calculation. The changes I made were:

   1. Use time varying =dz=

   2. There was an indexing bug where the free-surface field was offset
      from the density field by 1 grid point. Including time varying
      =dz= with this error resulted in a dipole pattern.

   3. Using single precision values results in a very noisy field. Noise
      is substantially reduced when using double precision computations.

-  Using =prsgrd32.h= (=DJ_GRADPS=) algorithim doesn't make things much
   better. The field is less noisier though.

-  That said, the bottom pressure hypothesis seems to work only when the
   trajectory has stalled out by quite a bit.

-  +I see a /negative/ bottom pressure anomaly developing towards the
   end. This makes sense because I want+
   $$β \iint ψ = - \iint p_\text{bot} s_{0y} = \iint p_\text{bot} α_\text{bot}$$
   since $s_{0y} = \pp{(-H)}{y} = -α_\text{bot}$

   However, there is the question of what my reference is (should be).
   What is 0 bottom pressure anomaly, i.e., what is the anomaly defined
   with respect to? *I need to take care of $\pp{}{y} \int p $*

-  Fixed bug in =syms_angmom=. $\dr A = r\dr r \dr θ$ *not*
   $\dr r \dr θ$

** 27 Feb 2015

-  Encouraging results with =syms_angmom=. Currently, it is sensitive to
   my estimate of bottom velocity (used to get bottom pressure). I need
   a better way. One possible solution is to subtract surface velocity
   from geostrophically balanced velocity. This will be an overestimate
   because of gradient wind.

-  =syms_angmom= - I was calculating $ru_θ$ but I need
   $yu = r\sin θ u_θ \sin θ$. So that accounts for a factor of $π$ when
   integrating $θ$ from 0 to $2π$ and reduces my earlier estimate by
   $½$.

** 18 Feb 2015

-  Use $\tanh$ fits for water depth at center gives much better
   estimates than =locate_resistance.=

-  I think =runew-3*= runs have the issue that the slope is not wide
   enough and so I'm not seeing the same trends that I see with the
   shallower slopes.

-  

** 16 Feb 2015

-  , when updated, doesn't look as good. There is some sensitivity to
   the amount of smoothing I put in =locate_resistance=. Alternatives
   are to try an exponential fit to =hcen= or use $\dd Et$ time series.

-  The good news is that =ew-6452= fits right where I expected it to.

-  I think I need to vary $β$ a bit and get some points in the shoulder
   region.

-  Fuck. Just found out that I was initializing eddies with non-zero net
   transport because I was using $f_0 + βy$ when calculating eddy
   velocities with thermal wind.

** 13 Feb 2015

-  Finally some progress. shows a plot of water depth at eddy center
   when $cv_y$ reduces by $½$ v/s the Flierl (1987) bottom torque
   hypothesis. Nice pattern. +Assuming that the eddy is always Gaussian
   (and so velocity profile is always an error fn.) doesn't seem to work
   in that I don't get a straight line.+ Fixed the error!

[[images/sl-resistance-bottorque.png]] [fig:bottorq]

** 12 Feb 2015

-  Meridional and zonal translational velocities scale very well with
   eddy velocity scale (at least initially).

Met with Ken:

-  $\dd Et$ is lower over the slope. Is this because $β$ and $β_T$
   oppose each other? Or, is it becuase the bottom torque balances a
   good fraction of the integrated angular momentum of the eddy?

-  Suggested that I could fit exponential to $cy$ v/s $t$ plot and get a
   time-scale from that.

-  Cross-isobath motion in the deep ocean is determined by background
   flow. How can I rationalize my setup with that?

-  Said that I should figure out bottom pressure hypothesis and think
   about outline.

-  Look at mid-depth temperature in =vvel_noise= to see if the waves
   from the sponge are barotropic or not.

** 09, 10 Feb 2015

-  Tested pure flat bottom run with no eddy. Velocities are very small
   $\SI{1e-8}{m/s}$ within the first 50 days, where predicts that if the
   eddy wasn't responsible, I should see signals of about
   $\SI{1e-3}{m/s}$ within first 50 days. Testing with larger $β$ now.
   *So, the eddy is responsible for Rossby waves running around the
   domain.*

-  Comparing \cite{Flierl1984a} scaling for energy decay time scale
   results in a prediction that is an order of magnitude larger than my
   $E/(dE/dt)$.

-  \cite{Nof1999} predicts decay that is too rapid.

** 05, 06 Feb 2015

-  =ew-6042-new= and =ew642-fb= don't show much difference in energy
   diagnostics. I'm starting =ew-34-fb= to check with $\Rh = 12$. .

-  However, =ew-34= does, at least in KE . It looks like vertical scale
   decreases faster with topography. KE decay is arrested quite
   dramatically. There is no difference in volume and PE evolution (is
   this due to my definition of the eddy core?)

-  Predicting wavelength of the features in deep water isn't going so
   well see =topowaves.m=. The features I see in the Hovmoeller plots
   are definitely slower than long Rossby wave speed.

-  Spectral analysis might not work well since I save data daily.

** 04 Feb 2015

Talked with Ken:

-  Likes the 3D eddy detection.

-  Agrees that the flat bottom comparision will be useful.

-  Told me to look at N-S energy flux in the eastern sponge.

-  Is there a Kelvin wave signal along topography?

-  Is the wavelength of free-surface features that of the first mode
   baroclinic wave?

-  How does the radiation of energy work for a wavemaker over a slope
   and for a meridional line source on a $β$ plane? Where does the
   energy go? Mostly offshore/onshore? Mostly eastwards or westwards? Is
   there a preferred direction for wave propagation?

** 03 Feb 2015

Met with Glenn:

-  Pointed out that I need to care about cross-isobath translation
   velocity as well as energy radiation. "Weaker eddies radiate more but
   also move more slowly."

-  Compare eddy decay with a flat bottom run. Does the slope extend the
   eddy's lifetime? At present the slope change in $dE/dt$ is not very
   evident. The comparision might make it more obvious.

   Ans: No, the eddy seems to decay faster with topography and .

-  Thinks that the OBC might be radiating Rossby waves, i.e., there need
   not be a Kelvin wave running around. If there's a phase difference
   between velocities, then the boundary can act like a wavemaker.

-  Energy budgets: I need to figure out if I can take out what's coming
   from the boundary. Difference between flux at edge of sponge and flux
   at OBC could help. Really, he thinks I should increase the strength
   of the sponge.

-  $U/βL^2$ should be "wave steepness" parameter rather than a Rhines
   number. It's a little hard to say why higher steepness means less
   radiation but effectively, the non-linearity prevents effective
   projection on to the modes in the surrounding medium.

   The idea is that the closed PV contours mean the the fluid within it
   is isolated and you can treat the PV contour as a rigid boundary.
   Then, the wave radiation problem becomes like that of a ship, i.e.,
   are you super- or sub-critical w.r.t to the wave modes in the
   surrounding medium.

-  Thinks its a good idea to follow up on my "resistance" thing.

** 02 Feb 2015

-  +Need to figure out long Rossby wave phase speeds and compare them to
   eddy westward translation speeds.+ OK. The \cite{Nycander1994}
   criterion is satisified i.e., the eddies move westwards slower than
   the long Rossby wave phase speed. So, the eddy must be radiating
   waves. Haha. This is /not/ in contradiction to
   \cite{Cushman-Roisin1990} since that paper's results are for low
   $\Ro$ eddies.

-  I'm going to try calculating some FFTs for points in deep water and
   points over the slope.

** 30, 31 Jan 2015

-  Working on energy fluxes. See [sec:enflux]

-  Breakthrough in eddy 3D structure detection. Use $δρ$ at the surface
   rel. vor. contour. See .

-  Increase in volume /averaged/ KE at later times coincides with
   increase in velocity scale of eddy, so that's good. Volume integrated
   KE, PE just decrease with time.

** 26 Jan 2014

-  The planetary Rossby waves I'm seeing have $λ ≈ \SI{70}{km}$ for
   =ew-04=. That's $≫ L_D = \SI{25}{km}$ and so, the PE flux dominates →
   that's what I see in my diagnostics.

-  +I need to look at efficiency of projection of a surface intensified
   Gaussian structure on planetary wave modes over a flat bottom and
   over a slope.+ This won't work because the modes are not orthogonal
   over a slope.

-  Ken says that I should expect $p\vec{u}$ to be the dominant KE flux
   contributor.

-  Need to parition the flux integration into 2: over topography and
   over flat-bottom.

** 23 Jan 2014

-  I think I was right all along and that =ew-6362= is an outlier. I
   think the $\Rh=3$ story holds for $\Rh=12$, but in the latter, it
   will take a lot longer to reach the shelfbreak since it is losing
   less energy to planetary Rossby wave radiation.

-  \cite{Flierl1994} pg. 364 mentions that planetary Rossby wave
   radiation from the eddy = "wave energy builds up in the lower layer".

** 21 Jan 2014

-  Working on bottom\_torque.m. Found a bunch of mistakes. Corrected
   pressure calculation, added code for momentum budget. I think my
   pressure field is still a bit weird though it looks fine. The
   integrated balance isn't working out.

** 19 Jan 2014

Met with Ken:

-  Do more low $S{_\text{sl}}$ runs with different scales.

-  Look for wave radiation signals with gently sloping runs.

-  Low $S{_\text{sl}}$ with larger eddies to see what difference that
   makes.

** 16 Jan 2014

-  Trying the \cite{Flierl1987} balance. Notes in .

-  I changed to using (ubar, vbar) but that doesn't make sense since I
   probably want to use the eddy dye to identify the eddy. Should revert
   that change.

-  Using eq. (15) in \cite{Flierl1987} should work better. Removes the
   ambiguity about defining $h$ and $Ψ$.

** 14 Jan 2014

Taking stock

-  I do /not/ think that all eddies end up one radius from shelfbreak.
   It seems like there's a limit that depends on Slope Burger number but
   /not/ Rossby number

-  Ken suggests hypothesizing that the eddies are adjusting to a steady
   state. /I need to confirm this by detecting 3D structure - probably
   worthwhile./

-  I should pay attention to bulk Burger number. Ken suspects the eddy
   is adjusting to some sort of steady state.

Notes:

-  It might be worthwhile to do 3D detection of zero vorticity surface.

-  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH. It looks like there might some $Ro/S_α$ dependence
   to these tracks after all.

-  I have also now noticed that in the gentler sloping runs the eddy
   doesn't leak much.

[[images/new-sl-tracks.pdf]] [fig:new-sl-tracks]

** 08, 09 Jan 2014

-  This Taylor cap idea is driving me nuts. It's unclear whether any of
   the previous results
   \citep{Hogg1973, Huppert1975, Chapman1992, Johnson1977} are
   applicable.

-  Taking a break and working on =locate_resistance.m= i.e., I'm trying
   to detect the change in trajectory and look for dependence on
   parameters.

-  There might be a pattern to where the eddy starts feeling resistance
   from topography

[[images/resistance.pdf]] [fig:resistance]

** 03 Jan 2014

-  Adding a wider shelf to runs with deeper shelfbreak results in a very
   different trajectory - /but/ they're exactly the same for a lot of
   it, so that's good. The difference is that with the 150km shelf, a
   much stronger shelf cyclone is created.

[[images/sb-wider-shelf.png]] [fig:sb-wider-shelf]

** 18 Dec 2014

-  Changing the stretching helped for =ew-b360=! There's still a little
   bit but I think I can tweak the stretching a little more. The
   strategy is to improve vertical resolution where $N^2$ is larger. I'm
   going to let this run.

-  +Shit. I'm seeing that runs =ew-6371, ew-6372= actually penetrate
   differently based on slope Burger number.+

-  +OK. I think the hypothesis of $\Ro / S{_\text{sl}}$ parameter being
   the dominant one is correct.+ See

** 17 Dec 2014

-  Seeing FS high-frequency noise as in for runs with exponential
   stratification (=bxxx=). Might muck around a bit with stretching
   functions.

-  The eddy cannot be losing all it's structure near the shelfbreak,
   because it *has* to lose structure in order to get there! So, it must
   be radiating stuff earlier. In fact, the amount of water lost later
   should be more for bigger eddies?

-  I think it's time to detect 3D eddy structure. The asflux
   calculations aren't telling me much. Vertical scale diagnostic for
   ew-642 starts decaying almost immediately. Actually, I can get a good
   estimate using =vor.Lmaj × vor.Lmin × Lgauss= for volume. Using the
   actual Gaussian and integrating gives some constant factor so that
   doesn't matter. shows the results for =ew-60xx=. I think this clearly
   shows that initially the core volume is approximately constant and
   then decreases when the eddy starts interaction with topography (just
   before big dots in plot). Another thing that is clear is that the
   eddy loses quite a bit before it gets to the shelfbreak ($t=1$).

-  So now the question is : what happens when the eddy starts
   interacting with topography - as defined by the change in slope of
   the volume time series.

[[images/Sl-vol.png]] [fig:slvol]

** 15,16 Dec 2014

-  Realized that I have a lot more runs to do:

   1. Deepen the whole domain (=2xxx=) but with wider shelves = 4 runs

   2. Duplicate above for $\Ro=0.25$ to see if there's a dependence = 4

   3. Duplicate above for $S{_\text{sl}}=0.25$ to see if there's a
      dependence = 4

   4. Exponential stratification runs = 4 runs

   5. +redo bottom friction runs = 4 runs+

   6. North-South isobath runs = 4

   7. +Redo =60xx= as =63xx=+

-  Must do some Taylor column reading today.

-  Sent application for Yellowstone cluster. Ken says he'll send his
   endorsement over the weekend.

** 12 Dec 2014

-  Ugh. forgot to change sponge locations for ns-* runs. Restarted all
   of them.

-  Also found out that I had =#undef SALINITY= even in my sbfront runs,
   so those are useless. Deleted them and resubmitted.

-  So, this morning I have recreated all oceanM files with appropriate
   sponges.

-  Set 3 runs with non-constant stratification with different $\Ro$.

-  Goal for the afternoon is to read \cite{Hide1966}.

Upon reading up on stratified Taylor column papers

-  \cite{Hogg1973} might have some clues. I can derive an equation for
   his $β$ that includes $\Ro$, $S{_\text{sl}}$ and
   $H{_\text{sb}}/ H_\text{eddy}$, i.e., my favourite parameters.

-  It seems like the critical value of $H{_\text{sb}}/ H_\text{eddy}$
   should be a function of $\Ro$ or $S{_\text{sl}}$.

-  $\Ro$ definitely appears in all these papers as a governing parameter
   so, my results should be sensitive to that.

** 10 Dec 2014

Found a bunch of vortex-ridge/seamount interaction papers. I will
summarize these in .

** 09 Dec 2014

Talked to Ken

-  Said I should talk about bottom friction, orientation of isoabths in
   manuscript.

-  Should talk to Doron Nof by mid-Jan

-  Thinks the \cite{Hassanzadeh2012} paper is a little screwy. Thinks
   that it should simplify to Charney scaling for in the low $\Ro$
   limit.

** 17, 18 Nov 2014

-  Doing some reading on eddy splitting.

-  Coded up runs.energy\_flux. I need to make it more useful - like a
   non-dimensionalized location to look at it.

-  I *have* to figure out how to relate what I'm seeing to the Shi & Nof
   papers about eddy-vertical wall interactions and the Nof, Cenedese &
   Herbette papers about eddy splitting over seamounts.

Met Ken:

-  Look up literature on interaction with ridges.

-  Need to do runs with varying vertical stratification and need to fill
   out threshold to nail down when eddies split.

-  Told me to starting writing up paper. Should get this ready by March
   definitely to show to Doron Nof. Wants to see 2-3 pages two weeks
   from now.

-  Said I should keep an eye out for GRC in summer 2015, Ocean Sciences
   in Feb 2016.

-  Says that explanation seems convincing enough.

-  Suggested I look at mass flux of dye rather than energy flux.

** 12 Nov 2014

-  +I need to do shelfbreak depth runs with a much wider shelf.+

-  +I also need to redo runew-6042 with a much bigger domain so that it
   makes it's way down to the shelfbreak.+

-  At her group meeting, Amala mentioned that I should be thinking of
   the fluid lost from the eddy core as a filament. Apparently, negative
   vorticity filaments are known to be less stable than positive
   vorticity filaments. There is no reference to this: she says this
   from experience.

-  I see the eddy splitting at the shelfbreak in runew-9340, runew-9341.
   What if it has always been splitting? Just that in most of the cases,
   the "splitting" is restricted by the fact that the slope comes up to
   a much shallower depth. So I should read up some on eddy splitting.

** 04 Nov 2014

Met Ken:

-  Now agrees with my shelfbreak depth hypothesis. His suggestion is
   that I pin down the critical (shelfbreak depth)/(eddy vertical scale)
   ratio for which the eddy is stopped - Suggested looking at it from
   the p.o.v of the question - "At what point does a ridge become a
   wall?" The way to show this would be to have a plot with (stopping
   distance)/$L_D$ on y-axis and (shelfbreak depth) on x-axis.

-  Since, I show that eddies stop 1 deformation radius away from the
   shelfbreak even when the slope of the shelf is changed, and that
   these eddies have very similar vertical scales - the eddies that land
   up in shallower water must show stronger energy radiation away?

** 31 Oct 2014

-  ew-3341 is done. shows tracks with y = distance of center from
   shelfbreak normalized by deep water deformation radius. These are for
   3 different values of slope width.

   [[images/34-penetration-slope-width.png]] [fig:34-penetration]

** 29-30 Oct 2014

-  Spent a lot of time mucking around with tracpy and ROMS. Found some
   idiosyncrasies - initial locations of ROMS floats are not saved. I
   don't think tracpy gets vertical movements right at all. So, not very
   useful then.

-  I think I should simplify my floats strategy while integrating ROMS
   and just deploy a whole bunch on the shelf at some point rather than
   having staggered deployment. I don't think it makes much difference.

-  After more careful look, it looks like Rh=12 runs don't show the
   penetration pattern like Rh=3 i.e., where Ro controls penetration.
   shows that there's no real pattern to eddy center location over slope
   at high Rhines number.

   [[images/Rh3.png]] [[images/Rh12.png]] [fig:Rh312]

-  Now, comparing ew-34 and ew-3440 with much wider shelfbreak shows
   that when normalized by deformation radius, the penetration is the
   same. I'm waiting for ew-3341 to finish to verify this.

** 20 Oct 2014

-  A new thought, what if the "minimum" or the closest the eddy gets to
   the shelf (at least initially), is determined by the time it takes
   for the flux to reach a large enough value that the shelf water
   cyclone forces the eddy to move northwards or away from the
   shelfbreak. So maybe I should look at a plot of integrated flux v/s
   time and compare that with a latitude v/s time. Presumally some
   normalized integrated transport would catch this?

Met Ken:

-  Thinks that the vorticity transport hypothesis is a good one.

-  Said that using the $<nn^T> = σ_n^2 I $ approximation for the fitting
   the straight line for flux estimate, is not so bad even if my $n$
   vector is sinusoidal (and so correlated). This is because it should
   get accounted for in the correction for number of degrees of freedom.

-  Clarified that I should do experiments where the width of the slope
   is wider with same shelfbreak depth to see if the eddy stalls
   earlier.

** 18 Oct 2014

-  Major upgrades to tracpy capabilities. As test run, I'm comparing the
   width of the supply jet for runew-04 and runew-8042. Does this agree
   with my passive tracer diagnostic? It does! See

** 16 Oct 2014

-  ew-2341 (hsb = 300m) and ew-2342 (hsb = 600m) both have a substantial
   portion of the eddy crossing topography, and then they stop because
   of the coastal wall. ew-2340 (hsb = 100m), looks more like normal
   with more flux and little more penetration over shelf.

-  

** 15 Oct 2014

-  Used MATLAB's =regress= to calculate error bars on mean flux estimate
   from integrated flux metric. This results in substantially reduced
   error bars. I need to look at the *15* runs more carefully, they seem
   to be a mess.

-  Finished friction runs and shelfbreak runs are close to completion.
   Will look at them tomorrow.

** 11 Oct 2014

-  Started 3 runs with shelfbreak depths of 100, 300, 600 m for eddy
   depth = 400m (ew-34) based and $\Rh = 12$. Had to reduce timestep for
   last two runs, not sure why but it was blowing up in the eddy.

-  Looked into integrating flux till first zero-crossing in depth
   integrated flux but that doesn't seem to work too well. I'll have to
   make the algorithm more complicated, not sure that it's worth it.

** 09 Oct 2014 - Committee Meeting III

-  Told me to concentrate on one topic: Glenn thinks I should work on
   fluxes, rest think that I should focus on penetration and that these
   two topics should get their own chapters.

-  To study whether the shelfbreak or the slope is stopping the eddy, I
   should do runs with deeper shelfbreaks. The extreme limit is what a
   baroclinic eddy does near step topography.

-  Amala still thinks I should do the frontal runs and check what's
   happening there.

-  THIS IS DONE. Glenn said the right way to get a mean flux is to fit a
   straight line to an integral flux.

-  Steve suggested plotting error in flux parameterization with $\Ro$ to
   check dependence.

-  They want to see a draft of what I will talk about before the
   committee meeting.

-  Should show a movie at the start next time.

** 05 Oct 2014

-  LTRANS is still screwing up. But I've got tracpy to work. Should not
   start at x=0. Fixed a bug with do3d too. The output still needs to be
   tested. Need to convert all my output to nc4-classic files
   unfortunately for netcdf4.MFDataset to work, but at least it will
   work with compressed files. I've updated my ROMS fork to save files
   in netcdf4\_classic\_mode.

** 03 Oct 2014

-  The runs are taking ages to complete....

-  Met with Joe Pedlosky this week. Told me to concentrate on the
   vorticity equation.

-  LTRANS isn't running properly :(. It hangs at some point in a routine
   from the tensions spline fitting.

** 26 Sep 2014

-  Started a bunch of runs: with Ro=0.15 and different slope burger
   numbers. Also, started 6343 and 6353

** 25 Sep 2014

-  runs *5* and *6* are very similar because they evolve to the same
   $λ \sim S_α \sqrt{\Bu}/\Ro$ parameter value. This means I should do a
   set of runs targeting $\Ro ~ 0.15$ or something. However, there is a
   difference in flux (slight): there is certainly a difference in
   maximum flux. But in terms of λ and penetration etc., they look the
   same.

-  Looked through the section on inertial boundary currents on the
   barotropic β plane in Pedlosky's book. The boundary layer length
   scale $\sim \sqrt{U/β}$ seems obvious in hindsight. I think the
   argument should work, you can get an inertial current with flow off
   the shelf if $β_T ≫ β$, which is generally the case. I'm thinking of
   a system where there is a meridional wall at the center of the eddy
   and the zonal flow on the shelf is forced offshore to satisfy an
   imposed offshore volume flux.

   There are two consequences of this hypothesis: one, it doesn't work
   with a flat shelf (the sign of planetary β makes it not work) and
   two, it says that the supply to water in the streamer comes from the
   upstream direction (in the CTW sense), rather than downstream. I can
   check 2 using offline float deployments. It does raise the question
   of why I see -ve ubar velocities on the shelf to the west of the
   eddy. I already have runs that vary β with flat shelf. I can see if
   there is variation.

-  Pre-Long Pond goals: start a bunch of runs first - Ro   0.15 since
   ew-05 and -06 end at same place for some reason. Then do offline
   deployment of drifters.

** 22, 23 Sep 2014

-  The reason that runew-6152 is different and the eddy runs all the way
   to the shelfbreak and crosses it is because $β/β_T \sim 0.8$. So,
   planetary β is almost as important as topographic β unlike the other
   runs. This is interesting.

-  I just realized that it might make sense to look at decay of
   free-surface ζ, and estimate a barotropic velocity scale using the
   gradient.

-  should look at eddye sections for 6**2 runs.

Met with Ken:

-  Parameterization is interesting. Spent a lot lot of time discussing
   outliers. Showed him the ζ profiles through the eddy center and how a
   Gaussian fit of some sort will not work. Suggested that the 7.5%
   fudge factor should be a function of $\Ro$ but agreed that doing some
   sort of Gaussian downscaling wouldn't work in this case.

-  Suggested goals: figure out a critical value for the $S_α/\Ro$
   parameter that distinguishes between "vertical wall" and "sloping
   bottom" cases.

-  Also suggested that I try and parameterize final vertical scale of
   the eddy as a function of $\Ro$ for the sloping bottom case.

-  Said that I should look for evidence of substantial penetration of
   slopes by offshore eddies: I should go through my Mendeley stack.

-  Must try Glenn's angular momentum integrated balance for the 6**2
   runs.

-  To figure out limit to which water can be extracted off the shelf,
   try a vorticity based argument like, $Δη < f$.

** 15, 16, 17 Sep 2014

-  Major axis length seems to be a decent metric for width of streamer.
   That means an fL/N scaling won't work for vertical scale of streamer,
   will it? Well, it says that the streamer is mostly barotropic which
   is what I see.

-  Seeing that maximum flux occurs when the eddy is straddling the
   shelfbreak, I should be able to parameterize maximum flux in terms of
   max eddy velocity (since the 0 vorticity contour gets to the
   shelfbreak), shelfbreak depth (assuming barotropicity) and diameter /
   major axis length (for streamer width). See

What new runs do I need?

1. Deeper shelfbreak so that I can test higher shelf Burger numbers

** 12 Sep 2014

-  Found that I had forgotten to update the statement that plotted error
   bars to account for new variable. But, even after trying estimate
   proper error bars, I can't tell the difference between many different
   runs. So, something to be explained. Varying Ro results in the
   biggest statistically significant difference. Runs ew-4* are also
   statistically different. They have same Ro but larger radii and so,
   have larger velocity scale.

-  To summarize, up to now, what makes the most difference is velocity
   scale of the eddy.

-  Is there a way to predict frequency at which eddy water is exported
   onto the shelf? i.e., frequency of oscillation in flux?

   Looking at major axis length, this frequency is ≅ 30-40 days
   generally. This is something like $\mO(βL_d)^{-1}$ timescale that
   \cite{Nof1999} uses. Essentially, you want time-scale for the whole
   eddy to move south i.e., diameter / southward velocity. This doesn't
   always work, I don't think.

-  Is the forcing on the shelf the same for all the runs where the
   fluxes are statistically indistinguishable from each other?

** 11 Sep 2014

-  Today I learnt that the oscillations in the flux diagnostic have
   highs when the eddy leaks water onto the shelf. This makes sense
   since that's when the forcing is on the shelf and so you can force
   water off faster. Most times, the flux is correlated (0.5) with major
   axis length (which is bigger when the eddy spills over onto the
   shelf). This is of course, sensitive to the contour detected. Worst
   case is runew-13 where they are anti-correlated at -0.5.

   This also explains why I see some negative flux in my calculation.
   This tends to happen when the eddy is splitting at the shelfbreak.
   Sometimes, , the detected eastern edge is far enough that my
   diagnostic captures some of the shelfwater export due to the
   secondary eddy that is being shef.

-  +One possible issue is that I define the flux as anything happening
   to the west of the eddy's eastern edge. I define the edge as /the
   eastern most point at the latitude line of the eddy's center./ Given
   this correlation with the leakage onto the shelf, I might want to
   compare this to flux calculated with an eastern edge defined as the
   /eastern-most/ point on the detected contour.+ WRONG. i fixed this
   some time ago. ee,ne,we,se are edges for the whole contour not just
   on the center's latitude line.

-  flux doesn't correlate well with vor.angle. I might have to roll out
   my own measure.

[[images/flux-negative.png]] [fig:flux-negative]

** 06 Sep 2014

-  Runs 3xx have Rh ≅ 12, and so, the eddies are bigger when over the
   slope compared to runs ew-13,04,15 where Rh ≅ 3. The fluxes are
   /lower/ and the centers are over deeper isobaths.

** 03 Sep 2014

-  Finally fixed issues with calculating fluxes when eddy detection
   algorithm doesn't run as long as the run.

-  I see increasing "baroclinicity" with increasing Ro now. A much
   stronger effect than what I noted earlier with increasing the shelf
   Burger number.

-  Runs with same $\Rh$ but different $\Ro$: Higher $\Ro$ eddies are
   bigger - centers are located at deeper isobaths, northern edge is
   farther away and southern edge is closer to shelfbreak. Radii differ
   by  3 km. Isobaths differ by 200 m .

-  I think at present, with $S_α$ = 1.5, the encounter is more like a
   vertical wall. The low $\Ro$ eddy radiates more and is smaller but is
   still exporting "eddy water" onto the shelf, so it's really close.

** 02 Sep 2014

-  Interestingly, adding a slope on the /shelf/ results in less
   transport (expected), less effective range (expected) and a slightly
   more bottom-intensified streamer (not expected). My next step is to
   compare the "baroclinicity" of the forcing to that of the streamer.

** 12 Aug 2014

-  +OK. It looks like what determines how close the eddy gets to the
   slope is a function of *Rhines number really.* For lower Rhines
   number, the eddy loses more of it's *outer* structure, and so "gets
   closer". In some sense, the edge of the 'eddy' always gets to the
   shelfbreak - at least for these runs. And the trends I'm seeing are
   explained by some eddies being 'bigger' than others. So, /I need to
   do runs with different Ro but same Rh./+ - Updated

** 07 Aug 2014

*Met with Ken*

-  He thinks the Taylor Proudman theorem might have something to do with
   figuring out the eddy's penetration. I did some scaling for the
   equations at the bottom boundary and nothing much came out of it.

-  Figuring out a scaled version that leads to the Taylor Proudman
   theorem might be interesting.

-  For now, I need more data points.

-  Looking at the section through the eddy center is not the best way to
   estimate $v$ since that's where you expect $v$ to be 0.

** 31 Jul 2014

-  Looks like the the secondary cyclones control too much of the
   evolution for ew-05.

** 24 Jul 2014

-  I'm convinced that in general, my eddies with alpha = 3 are unstable
   over a flat bottom.

-  \cite{Flierl1988} shows that the width of the outer annulus of
   opposite signed vorticity is a factor. The "deep flow" is also a
   factor i.e, for my eddies with large vertical scale it's essentially
   like a deep co-rotating flow and this stabilizes the vortices.

   Assuming there is some characteristic vertical scale, an "eddy" with
   vertical scale greater than that will be stabilized but however, will
   adjust "strongly" on the beta-plane (ew-743). When less than that, I
   think the appropriate deformation radius is more like a layered model
   and so, smaller (ew-745). And thus, my eddy is larger than the
   appropriate deformation scale - this is also favourable for
   instability \citep{Flierl1988}.

-  So, I need low values of alpha for the Katsman profile = essentially
   a Gaussian profile in the horizontal for the eddy.

-  At this point, I think I should plot up the ADCP velocity from the
   line W cruise and see how Gaussian that is.

** 18 Jul 2014

-  ew745-bg and ew745-nobg (both with topo) are very similar in
   diagnostics - fluxes, eddy scales etc.

-  ew745-fb(nobg) is quite different. I need to do flat-bottom with bg
   flow to check. - Run has been started.

** 17 Jul 2014

*Met with Ken*

-  *Vertical scale:* Ken thinks that using the dye to define the eddy
   isn't too unreasonable. Suggested doing a couple more runs to nail
   down (fL/NH) dependence and /that it might depend on Ro/.

-  Using near bottom shear for "slope parameter" isn't too justified
   especially where bottom friction comes in.

-  Suggested that I calculated energy flux both upstream and downstream
   of eddy to quantify CTW and Rossby wave radiation.

-  Suggested that I do a better estimate of eddy velocity scale. Just
   picking max surface velocity is noisy becuase as the eddy stretches
   adn squeezes, I will see an increase in velocity scale. Suggestions:
   sqrt(KE), circulation along contour, averaged vorticity/f.

** 16 Jul 2014

-  Steve points out that I should be looking at the pressure forcing at
   the shelfbreak. Is that "in phase" with the offshore velocity? he
   posits that the cross-shelfbreak transport is geostrophically
   balanced. Now, I generally assume that the pressure forcing is
   symmetric about the eddy center. This would mean cross-shore
   geostrophic transport west of eddy center. BUT, there are Kelvin
   waves & CTWs adn TRWs over the slope - that will spread the forcing
   in the downstream direction. So, I should look at that.

-  Having looked at above, that hypothesis seems right. There is a
   downstream (in CTW sense) spreading of the pressure signal, and the
   cross-shelfbreak velocity (at least at the surface) is found at the
   location of SSH gradient. See and .

-  It looks like eddy translation speed > barotropic rossby wave speed
   over the shelf. Must look this up in \cite{Qiu1990}.

[[images/ew04csvelhov.png]] [fig:csvelhov]

[[images/ew04zetahov.png]] [fig:zetahov]

** 15 Jul 2014

-  Using =runs.csvel_hov=, I see that the signal in cross-shore velocity
   close to the coast moves westwards faster than the eddy translates.
   This tendency decreases the closer you get to the shelfbreak. I also
   see more cross-isobath transport to the west of the eddy when I move
   away from the shelfbreak.

   It looks like there's a lobe of northward velocity (like a mirror
   image of the eddy) on the shelf that "spreads" westwards - due to
   $\beta$? The way to test this would be to run with a sloping shelf.
   Any slope > i.e., slope burger number > should work.

-  Transport near the center might have something to do with orientation
   of the eddy's major axis w.r.t the shelfbreak. If so, I should see a
   correlation between this angle and flux?

** 14 Jul 2014

-  Learnt that most vscale runs with topo had friction. UGH. re-running
   them now.

-  Realized that I wasn't accurately calculating transport by
   restricting myself to transport west of the eddy center. Turns out,
   most transport occurs around the eddy center and east of it too. In
   fact, most of it occurs between the eastern and western edges of the
   eddy's 0 relative vorticity contour.

   With this correction, transport seems to scale linearly with depth of
   shelfbreak, unlike earlier.

-  I'm noticing an increased contribution to fluxes just above the
   bottom with bottom friction. This is weird.

-  Plotting up shelfwater transfer envelopes shows that some runs don't
   reach eqbm i.e., If I ran for longer I would see water from farther
   onshore crossing the shelfbreak - for most runs.

-  Now I think that the reason I'm seeing large transport near the
   center of the eddy is because of the anticyclonic vorticity exported
   out of the eddy core eastward of the eddy. This would also imply that
   the factor controlling "range" of the eddy is dependent on the extent
   to which eddy water is exported onto the shelf. /There could also be
   some contribution from the streamer's cyclonic vorticity but
   doubtful/

** 30 Jun 2014

-  OK. Bottom friction isn't imparting cyclonic vorticity to shelf water
   in the streamer. It's spinning down the along-shore jet, downstream
   of the eddy. That's why it's contribution to the vorticity budget is
   cyclonic. See

[[images/bfricvor.png]] [fig:bfricvor]

** 19 Jun 2014

1. 

** 27 May 2014

1. sqrt(VISC4) = 42 does not kill noise even when mixing along
   s-surfaces.

** 22 May 2014

1. Changed =water_census= to use $x_{sb} \le x \le x_{sl}$ as criterion
   for slope water. This gets rid of one-grid point shifts in water
   parcels. Volume of slope water on shelf and in deep water is now 0 at
   t = 0.

** 08 May 2014

1. Found that I wasn't comparing runs with same X-domain length when
   checking the effect of grid stretching.

2. Also, I have runs checking how big the pressure gradient error is. It
   looks like I get velocity   2cm/s in 80 days with the horizontal grid
   stretching. I have a run where the grid isn't stretched at the
   western boundary to see if that makes a difference. Max. erroneous
   velocity is seen at the start of this grid stretching.

3. I have a constant 750m resolution run going to see what happens, but
   it seems to be slow. I might have to do the 750m run in a stretched
   grid and see how different things are.

4. No more work has been done on analyzing the Line W data. I think it
   might be useful to compare vertical structure of the eddy after it
   has adjusted to the slope and compare that to the data.

5. I need to do some thinking about what the effect of a $N^2$ based
   stretched vertical co-ordinate would be on topography. Update: I
   don't the think the stretching has any effect on total water depth,
   but a local slope burger number would be different. Essentially I
   would need a varying bottom slope to compensate for variation in
   $N^2$.

** 24 Apr 2014

1. Found that there was a mistake in my run numbering. Old ew-07 is now
   ew-09. Comparing two runs, one with uniform dx=1km and the other with
   non-uniform grid spacing shows large qualitative differences. I'm now
   checking to see if there is decent enough quantitative agreement.

2. Look at statistics of WCR properties in castelao.ipynb shows that WCR
   radii are 2-4 times larger than the first baroclinic mode deformation
   radius in the area. This is worrying. I need to look up eddy
   instability theory.

3. I have two issues to resolve

   -  Do I just increase my eddy radius by an adjustable parameter?

** 21 Apr 2014

1. Realized that blowup trouble was because of rotated viscosity in
   sponge. I've changed it so that I can control the rotation for the
   harmonic/biharmonic diffusion/viscosity operators individually.

2. My BIG runs - ew-208/209 - had trouble : in one, the background vel
   was too fast. The other issue was that I raised beta to 8e-11 which
   reduced the Rhines number quite a bit - disappeared into waves.

3. So, my issue with the older low Ro runs was that Rh was pretty low
   too. I should reduce beta so that I have an eddy with low Ro and high
   Rh.

** 14 Apr 2014

1. N=72 run seems pretty good.

2. I have now implemented grid telescoping in roms\_create.m. This
   requires scaling viscosities by grid cell size - activated by
   =VISC_GRID= and =DIFF_GRID=. This is easier to implement in the
   latest ROMS version but that involves sponges defined using
   visc\_factor and diff\_factor. This applies to both visc2 and visc4,
   which I don't want. So, I set visc\_factor, diff\_factor = 1
   everywhere and copy my sponge code in ana\_hmixcoef.h to
   ana\_sponge.h

** 10 Apr 2014

1. dx=1km,N=30 has instability. I'm now trying with dx=1,N=36,40 to see
   if that helps.

2. Gordon replied. He has dx=500m, dy=400m, dt=80s, VISC1=TNU2=1, 60
   vertical levels, stretching (2,2), GLS k-kl, - way more resolution
   than I can afford, I think.

3. I also have lower timestep run (which I doubt will change anything
   based on Gordon's reply).

** 09 Apr 2014

1. Instability appears later with 40 points. Increasing vertical
   resolution is the only thing that is working yet.

2. I'm trying with increased AKv\_BAK, k-omega mixing and dt=60s to see
   if either of those help.

** 08 Apr 2014

1. slopebreak instability still appears with increased number of points
   (40), different stretching (1,1,500,36). I also see it with slope =
   0.04, H = 2200m, [3,3,500,60]. But it's very weak. Different
   stretching should fix it.

** 07 Apr 2014

1. VISC4=1e6 (aces:runew-07-visc4) does not work

2. Here's what I know, with slope = 0.04, H = 2200m, 60 points (dzmax =
   50m) is good enough to prevent this. slope = 0.02, H = 1100m, 36
   points (dzmax = 41.7m) is *not* good enough.

3. I have two runs going to check if getting dzmax to less than 40m
   works. One where stretching is now [1,1,500] instead of [3,3,500] and
   N = 40 i.e, with dzmax = 35m

** 05 Apr 2014

1. VISC2=1 is too little to kill the slopebreak numerical instability
   even with N=36 when maxdepth = 1100m. So, I'm now running VISC2+VISC4
   where VISC4= 1e6 to kill numerical instability while VISC2 is only
   non-zero in sponge. runew-07-visc4 on aces is testing this. Fingers
   crossed!

** 03 Apr 2014

The new runs (slope=0.02, visc2=1, nobc) have some problems

1. VISC2=1 is too low to kill the numerical instability I was seeing at
   the slopebreak earlier. So, I need more vertical points.

2. Long rossby wave speed is 0.096 m/s which is too close to background
   flow - looks like I was seeing some trapping phenomena due to this. I
   also updated my Shc OBC code to be the more efficient version iwth
   one sqrt computation. But it looks like that code is fine.

3. Eddies with very low Rossby number disperse into waves on the beta
   plane and are hence, useless.

** 26 Mar 2014

1. The dynamics of RV (or PV) make a huge difference. If the shelf is
   not deep enough, then there is an excess of cyclonic vorticity that
   amasses near the shelf (Is this on the shelf?). If it is deep enough
   then the cyclonic vorticity never intensifies as much. But the
   interior of the eddy leaks mass and vorticity in a pulsing manner
   onto the shelf. If there is a flat bottom, then the behaviour near
   the wall is similar to that with a deep shelf in that there is
   vorticity export from the core. I need to quantify this.

2. My simulations might be too viscous :(

** 24 Mar 2014

1. I've started two runs with higher Ro. ew-09 is same as ew-06 but
   higher $\Ro$. ew-10 is parametrically the same as ew-09 with
   =f0/2, beta/2, s_sl/2, T_amp/2= - i.e., parametrically the same but
   half the bottom slope. Seeing whether this will help $w$ noise.

2. Plots show that vorticity flux across the shelfbreak is episodic and
   that results in vortices being formed over the shelf. The eddy
   contour (as determined using rvor = 0) crosses the shelfbreak by a
   couple of points. Notes added to eddy behaviour section.

** 23 Mar 2014

1. runew-06-sp40-nobc has noise in the same place. Water does not run
   out of my domain. I still need to compare zeta evolution in more
   detail.

2. 

** 21 Mar 2014

1. Vertical velocity noise is back - ew-06-sp40 - But I had increased dt
   to 120s. Now, I have 3 runs queued / running checking for
   dt=110,100,90s. Hopefully, this helps. Again, remember that
   runew-06-spall-const-5d-4-shc did not have such trouble but it was
   running at dt=90s and had VISC2=3 only.

2. Ugh, on scylla, runew-06-nudge-shc, has vertical velocity noise and
   some wave issues even though it has nudging. So, vertical velocity
   noise is

   1. insensitive to timestep

   2. insensitive to M2 nudging

   3. insensitive to sponge size

   4. sensitive to initial location of the eddy. It occurs when I start
      with eddy far away from the shelf but not when it's started close
      to the slope. In the latter, it looks like internal waves forced
      by the eddy reflecting of topography into deep water. It also
      starts later in the latter case.

3. So here's what I can do: scylla:runew-06-shc-nobc has all the
   following

   1. Open the northern boundary and see if allowing internal waves to
      radiate out there helps.

   2. Make RadNud boundary conditions for 3D variables so that there is
      some damping of anomalies

   3. Try without VOLCONS and see if that makes zeta behave better.

4. I should also do a run with 5d-4 rdrag - Ken's suggestion from long
   ago.

5. I am going to spend some time looking at the barotropic instability
   problem.

** 20 Mar 2014

1. Fixed OBC problem by fixing Shc boundary condition. There were 2
   bugs.

2. I've been studying the formation of the anti-cyclone over the shelf.
   Notes earlier.

** 06 Mar 2014

1. 50 day nudging is too slow, nothing really different.

2. visc2=7 smoothens out some of the noise but there's still something
   that appears at the head of the cyclone moving eastward and stuff
   west of the anticyclone.

** 05 Mar 2014

Started 2 runs with nudging layers. One has visc=7 + OBCs and other has
visc=6 + Periodic. Based on runew-06-z60-improv2-a4visc, the w noise
starts much later with VISC2=5. VISC2=7 is definitely too high for
streamer etc. but I'm trying to see if that kills it completely.

** 03 Mar 2014

1. Looking at runew-06-improv3-bt0 - small domain: I can see a
   barotropic wave signal in zeta running around the domain. The
   vertical velocity noise is growing prior to this happening.

** 02 Mar 2014

Had to restart =runew-06-improv3-big= and =runew-06-improv3-big-my25=
because i forgot to add initial BT vel.

*However, my25 run doesn't show much elevated mixing at 52 days. Should
recheck tomorrow.*

Also started periodic run : =runew-06-improv3-big-per=

The vertical velocity noise seems to reliably start near the edge of the
sponge layer.

** 01 Mar 2014

Started runs =runew-06-improv3-big & -big-bt0=. Only difference is big
domain.

Also did =runew-06-improv3-big-my25= with =MY25_MIXING= with
=tke,AKt,AKv= output to check what that does.

Also, =runew-06-improv3-volcons= is re-running with my updated VOLCONS
code.

I need to try what bstress in /all/ sponges does. Might have to add some
interior nudging to overcome it in EAST/WEST sponges. This seems messy.

1. =UV_DRAG_GRID= and =ANA_DRAG= in combination required for spatially
   varying bottom drag.=runew-06-improv3-bstress= has some weird
   behaviour but maybe that's because max =rdrg= = 1e-3 is too much.
   There is still a cyclone formed that has trouble exiting the
   boundary.

2. RadNud on zeta, ubar with 360 day outgoing and 5 day incoming
   timsecale doesn't improve it - =runew-06-improv3-radnud=

3. =runew-06-big= looks best for now. So I need to do
   =runew-06-improv3-big=.

4. With no background flow, the $w$ crap stays /somewhat/ stationary.
   This is a clue but to what? I also see no increase in =AKv, AKt=
   associated with it. So, that's good. But, I also see no value >
   background mixing ever - so that's bad.

** 26 Feb 2014

1. Attempted alternative form of continuity eqn budget - doesn't work as
   well as earlier one.
   $$(u_x)_\sigma + (v_y)_\sigma - \pp zx \pp u\sigma - \pp zy \pp v\sigma + H_z^{-1} \pp w\sigma = 0$$

2. Ok, I think [3,3,1000] maybe the best thing to try. runew-06-z60 has
   FS trouble but no other weirdness - except for the wave pattern in
   the last sigma layer. Maybe sue RadNud on FS with really weak nudging
   on outflow

3. I'm doing 2 new runs with improv3 = [3,3,500] based on ew-06-scylla
   looking decent.

   runew-06-improv3 - just new stretching - small domain - seeing what
   FS will do. RadNud on FS at inflow edge - 360 day outflow nudging, 5
   day inflwo nudging

   runew-06-improv3-bt0 = above but with no background flow - just to
   see what happens. Changed all inflow BCs to Rad

** 25 Feb 2014

1. Noticed 2 kinds of small scale waves in rvor field at surface (and at
   depth) near the shelfbreak. One looks like grid scale noise. Other
   might be edge wave.

2. Okubo Weiss parameter doesn't seem useful in diagnosing region south
   of the eddy where I'm interested in doing a vorticity budget

** 24 Feb 2014

1. "Sigma error of the second kind" is not what I'm seeing since
   \cite{Mellor1998} shows that it does not exist for 2D bathymetry.

2. inflow FSOBC = Rad *reduces* high frequency zeta oscillations, does
   not kill it. Also, this is not seen with the old [3,3,100] stretching
   (ie. runew-06-z60 and runew-06-z50).

3. Doing run on big domain and run with smaller timestep (improv2) to
   see if that helps the FS oscillations. Also running the improv2-fsrad
   run for longer time. It actually doesn't have too bad behaviour.

** 23 Feb 2014

1. Runs started yesterday haven't run to completion. However, I can
   verify that outflow FSOBC = Rad fixes high frequency oscillation
   problem *associated with the new stretching [1,1,500].*

2. New stretchign also has bottom boundary weirdness so that looks
   pretty unavoidable.

3. 

** 22 Feb 2014

1. Both improv2 ([1,1,500]) runs with mpdata and a4 show high frequency
   oscillations in zeta which I haven't seen before. This could be
   because of making the boundary condition Chapman Explicit (Che). *No!
   This is because of new stretching. Improv1 stretching does not have
   it even with Che BC*

2. On aces, running without VOLCONS worked for quite a bit till weird
   stuff came in from the outflow boundary.

3. Viscosity up to 5 MKS doesn't help the vertical velocity noise
   problem. *I do not see the old instablility problem with this new
   stretching [1,1,500]*

** 21 Feb 2014

1. With new stretching *improv1 = *[3,1.5,500], dzmax = 56m and I see my
   old instability friend. I also need a shorter timestep. Non-periodic
   run blows up at 18 days.

2. The dzmax and haney criterion are in opposition. I'll have to reduce
   $\Delta x$ too.

3. Periodic boundaries show better FS behaviour for now. FSOBC=Cha at
   outflow boundary hasn't run yet.

4. Must do Akima run again.

5. *Evening update:* scylla has akima & mpdata runnning on exactly same
   setup ([1 1 500]) in run-6 and run-7. Must compare tomorrow morning.
   I have the akima run-6 run going on aces too but without VOLCONS just
   to see what happens.

6. There are two more things I can think off - higher horizontal
   resolution or higher VISC2.

7. Ken says my slope of 0.04 on the slope is at the high end which is
   good. Hopefully if things work on this, then I shouldn't have much
   problem later.

[[images/fsobc-east-chapman.png]] [fig:zetaobc]

** 19 Feb 2014

1. Wrote water mass census code.

2. I still don't know why aces doesn't conserve volume.

3. Trying an spen run to see if that improves zeta behaviour. - doesn't
   work

** 18 Feb 2014

1. Ok, I'm still having trouble getting stuff to run on aces. Totally
   weird stuff happens near boundaries even though i've copied the input
   file from scylla. *Volume conservation is not working!!*

2. Increased vertical resolution seems to have helped. The pattern of
   vertical velocity is a lot different now and is bottom intensified
   which seems more reasonable. see . runew-06-z50 with
   =[\theta_s \theta_b] = [3 3]= still shows the edge instability.
   runew-06-z60 doesn't.

3. About the FS problem, the earlier spen runs don't have it as bad. In
   those runs, the FS goes weird once stuff that evolves east of the
   eddy gets to the sponge. The dye\_04 field shows a feature that's
   pretty close to the edge when weird stuff happens. There are /three/
   things different:

   1. background flow is faster at 4 v/s 2 cm/s. There could be some
      Doppler shifting effect with the slower velocity that makes things
      worse.

   2. Two, the eddy starts out a lot farther away from the boundary,
      though even runs with a bigger domain don't behave like spen runs.

   3. There's now an inflow sponge. Maybe that prevents stuff from
      escaping because the sponge is too intense?

** 15 Feb 2014

1. VISC4 with z60 doesn't help.

2. 100 km sponge with VISC2=3-120 does not help. I have no clue on what
   to do next, except seriously try and solve for a QG wave solution at
   the boundary.

3. The good news (of sorts) is that I have more data now. Need to
   download z50 and z60 runs and compare with z40.

4. +One hypothesis is that with 50/60 points the thing is actually
   resolved and it's bottom intensified. The coarse 40 point grid was
   modifying it earlier?+

** 14 Feb 2014

1. Instability is a vertical grid problem (see ) +but increasing points
   to n=60 doesn't help much. With n=60 max. $\Delta z = 40$m but that
   doesn't seem to help.+ *This was wrong. I was using
   =[\theta_s \theta\_b] = [3 0.5]= instead of =[3 3]=*

2. Interestingly runew-06-z50 shows different behaviour in zeta w.r.t
   the barotropic wave stuff I've been seeing. Something is connected
   here.

3. runew-06-bigsp is running to see whether a wider less, abrupt sponge
   works better at letting stuff go out the open boundaries.

Here's my thinking

1. I have trouble that manifests itself where the vertical grid spacing
   is maximum.

2. I could increase vertical viscosity but that will mess up tracer
   stuff and mixing.

3. So, maybe I should kill it using horizontal tactics - i.e., increase
   horizontal resolution and use increased viscosity.

4. Increased harmonic viscosity is not the best idea, so time to do
   biharmonic experiments again. I'll have to deal with time-step
   limitation in sponge either by reducing timestep or using MIX\_S

** 06 Feb 2014

1. ew-06-big still has big domain scale wave problem. Temperature
   profiles look at lot more normal. In-eddy and shelfbreak upwelling
   observed in earlier runs still exists!

2. I'm still working on getting good streamer cross-section extraction
   code.

3. Have put in code that does some statistics on streamer.

** 03 Feb 2014

1. I'm running ew-02-big to see whether bigger domain helps with that
   weird Rossby wave problem.

2. Reducing TKE\_min has removed "mixed layer" problem.

3. 

** 28 Jan 2014

Meeting with Ken:

1. Am I conserving temperature and other tracers?

2. Look at cross section of dye + velocity vectors 20m above bottom.

3. Ken says I should think about getting to change vertical scale
   independent of everything else. Adding more vertical modes might be
   the better way of doing this. Should look at imposing an exponential
   vertical structure and finding consistent horizontal structure.

** 27 Jan 2014

1. Cross-section plots of z-dye show near-shelfbreak upwelling and
   possibly some slope water coming onto the shelf.

2. I need to remove effect of the BC though.

** 24 Jan 2014

1. Running on both aces and scylla now.

2. Need to figure out how to make changes in N & f i.e., deformation
   radius feasible.

3. Will write python script to plot ROMS text file output - run after
   every script.

4. I' trying to figure out some clever way to visualize upwelling using
   the dyes.

5. Still need to figure out float deployment strategy.

6. Started looking at z-dye field. Notes in

** 22 Jan 2014

Latest insight is that there is a strong velocity gradient at the
eastern side of the eddy right at the beginning. Thus, there is a strong
/offshore/ velocity field right next to the eastern edge that transports
a lot of slope water offshore. When the eddy gets over the slope, this
gradient smooths out in the CTW direction.

On computing resources:

1. scylla runs are getting terminated because of excessive load.

2. I've figured out how to get netcdf4 compilation work on aces. Do the
   compilation in an interactive session, then exit and submit the
   script.

3. 

** 19 Jan 2014

My runs are getting terminated for some unknown reason. I've emailed
Greg about fixing this.

Today's goal is to look into streamer dynamics. I'm putting vorticity
budgets on the backburner temporarily.

** 07 Jan 2014

Here's my plan of action

1. Redo periodic + sponge layers in bigger domain with eddy farther
   away. Must try TS\_MPDATA to see if tracer behaves better.

2. I need a flat bottom run (smaller domain) to test out vorticity
   diagnostics and compare "image effect"

3. In the meantime, I need to do more detailed comparisons between the
   periodic w+w/o sponge runs. Or at least get the code ready for when
   the model output arrives.

On the analysis front, I'm having trouble making the vorticity budget
work with the averaged data. I'm going to try checking it with the
history file. However, the tilting and stretching term show a negative
band at the shelfbreak - I'm not sure if this is an artifact from my
differentiation.

** 30 Dec 2013

*periodic/no-sponge v/s periodic/sponge* (runew-03-per-sp v/s
runew-03-per)

1. Need to compare center tracks since eddies don't start in exactly the
   same place. But it looks like with sponge, the trajectory is more
   meridional.

2. This sponge strength (max. 100) seems to be good at killing most of
   what is radiated away.

** 08 Nov 2013

1. Extra smoothing of transition to deep water does not help - seems
   more intense in fact - see runew-03-smooth

2. Now I'm checking whether decreased vertical resolution near the
   bottom is the reason = I doubt. Doesn't seem like it. BH number is
   larger near the shelfbreak not slopebreak.

3. Now I'm trying periodic BC's with and without sponges (ew-03-per,
   ew-03-per-sp). Let's see how well these work.

** 04 Nov 2013

1. Trying to predict southward translation velocity based on ideas in
   \cite{Early2011}. Works best for max $v$ in first 30 days,
   $v_r = \beta L_R^2$ and $v_{gw} = NH$,$U$ is eddy vel scale (see )
   $$\frac{v_\text{max}}{v_s} = 14.5 \quad ; \quad v_s = -v_r \cdot v_r/v_{gw} \cdot \mathit{Rh} = - v_r \cdot \frac{U}{NH}$$

   Clearly, there is some quadratic dependence that I don't capture but
   this will work till I get more data points.

[[images/eddyvel-regress.png]] [fig:eddyvel]

** 01,02 Nov 2013

1. Still working on estimating propagation speeds.

2. I'm re-running runew-03-pt with 4 tracers to check effectiveness of
   tagging eddy. I will redo other runs with tracer once I figure this
   out I guess. should check run tonight.

3. Running with timestep of 120s seems to work well.

4. I need to recode the float deployment stuff / make a matlab script
   that makes it easy for me to create a =floats.in= file.

** 31 Oct 2013

1. Had to restart ew-08 and ew-09 since I didn't have the folder right.

2. Comparing runew-06-vis3 and vis4. $w$ field is clean even with
   vis2=3, eddy properties overlap (using compare\_plot).

3. Ken likes idea of flat bottom runs to check image effect.

4. I'm now working on estimating the non-linear correction to drift
   speed.

** 30 Oct 2013

1. I still see some "noise" over the slope. I don't know yet whether it
   is connected with the eddy moving over the slope. runew-07 was
   supposed to fix this by doing an f-plane run with the eddy far away
   from the slope. But it was too close and i've learnt nothing new.

2. In some good news, using a shallower domain doesn't seem to cause any
   problems (runew-06).

3. I need to ask Ken about viscosity values to use but except for this
   "noise" over the slope, everything seems alright.

4. Passive tracer field needs more diffusivity - tnu2=1 doesn't work
   well enough. See below.

5. I'm redoing runew-03 with a passive tracer and tnu2=2 to see if it's
   useful with PT initialized at the start.

** 22,23 Oct 2013

1. Coded =integ2layer.m= making good use of Neil Banas' code -
   =roms_depthIntegrate.m=. This integrates between -Z/2 and 0 & -Z and
   -Z/2. Output looks reasonable. I need to apply it to vorticity.

2. *Finally fixed sponge layer! added =visc2_r,diff2_t,diff2_s= output
   to history files.*

3. Initial runns-01-res* runs seem to blow up. +Trying with closed
   boundaries and wider sponge.+ Closed boundaries work. Big sponge
   doesn't.

** 21 Oct 2013

1. I've started runew-11-18 with much bigger domain and 50km sponge.
   Trying to see if that will make a difference. I think it is unlikely
   since the biharmonic visc acts at much smaller scales. If this
   doesn't work, I'll finalize on =visc2==

2. I need to verify my earlier observation of eddies going in odd
   directions. will setup runs for this tonight.

** 17 Oct 2013

1. Fixed sponge layer tiling bug. Now using =xl(ng)= and =el(ng)= to
   determine domain extents.

2. Trying out some runs with =UV_VIS4= & =TS_DIF4=. These seem to help
   but I need values slightly higher than runew-11-14/ which uses
   =visc4==2e5 and =tnu4==0. Sponge values are =maxvisc==1e6,
   =maxdiff==1e4.

3. +With harmonic viscosity, I've bounded the required value between
   $1 \le$ =visc2= $\le 2.5$.+ =VISC2=2.5= seems to kill off everything
   pretty fast. Values of 1.5 and 2 let the noise grow a bit.

4. I still have a standing wave pattern in the sponge layer that I do
   not know how to kill. This pattern is confined to sponge region, very
   small oscillations seen in $w$ outside it. Ken says we ignore it.

5. Learnt that maxing out the colorbar on the $w$ field makes for really
   lurid visualization. Shows noise and internal waves banging around.

6. Ken spotted a crosshair pattern in $w$ field in the center of the
   eddy. It looks like I need viscosity to kill it. VISC4 (runew-11-15)
   works better than best VISC2 (runew-11-11) run. VISC4 seems to be the
   way to go. I need to narrow down the value reqd.

** 09 Oct 2013

Fixed sponge layer. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was. I've just
limited the maximum now. However, I've learnt that the sponge wasn't as
strong as I thought it was - so that's fixed.

Ken suggested that I add some VISC2 background to kill noise associated
with OBCs. Hopefully this will work. I have a bunch of runs going to see
how little viscosity I can get away with. He suggested 10 MKS as a
starting point - this will kill grid scale noise on a day's timescale.

** 07 Oct 2013

Inflow sponge crashes really fast.

Right now, I have noise coming in at both open boundaries. Both effects
are present in *all* runs, I think. The problem at the outflow boundary
is not so important. It seems spatially constrained. The inflow boundary
"instability" appears at following times

[htbp]

| Run     | Time to "instability"   | $S_{sl}$   |
|---------+-------------------------+------------|
| ew-06   | 100                     | 1.3        |
| ew-11   | 40                      | 0.64       |

[tab:instab]

** 06 Oct 2013

-  ACESGRID has smae CPUs as mohawk. Runs are slow, will take more than
   a day. Playing around with tiling shows that 4x3 works best. Strategy
   will be to run multiple runs at the same time.

-  Looks like I have nudging troubles. I get an instability over the
   slope. See . The gradients are small but there is definitely
   something happening. I also see some small scale structure in
   vorticity behind the eddy. /Might need a sponge layer at the inflow
   end. Ugh!/ This issue affects all runs to date? *Sponge layer at
   inflow end does not work.*

-  Wider sponge seems to have fixed the basin mode problem! yes! -
   runew-08-02 on aces

[[images/modelinstab.png]] [fig:modinstab]

** 01 Oct 2013

Some discoveries

-  *Increased Shelf Width - runew-08 : *Increasing shelf width to 60 km
   shows some weird probably aphysical barotropic wave over the shelf.
   I'm running at lower Courant number now to see if it's a barotropic
   timestepping problem. The intent was to check whether the image
   effect depended on just the width of the shelf. The answer is no, I
   still see the eddy go back in the opposite direction.

-  Changing $\beta$ and $\Ro$ (runew-10) doesn't make much difference in
   eddy tracks. I need to flesh this out more.

-  The eddy reverses dirn to move in a manner consistent with rossby
   wave propagation & the image effect. But which is it? Reading lit.

What I should do now is figure out whether the barotropic velocity field
is being modified and if that's what's making the eddy move backwards.
Since I haven't saved ubar,vbar this will involve doing some hefty
calculation.

Quick look at gestrophically balanced ubar,vbar doesn't show much. I
need to get rid of the eddy's velocity field.

** 25 Sept 2013

I ended up doing the same run thrice!

But now, I have more interesting things

-  at ubt = 0.02 m/s, the image effect tends to overpower the background
   flow. The eddy starts moving against the mean flow. not seen at ubt =
   0.04 m/s (same eddy), but my domain may not be long enough for me to
   see this.

-  Surface vorticity plots don't shed much light.

-  I see a decrease in vertical scale that parallels decrese in bottom
   depth (corr. coeff. $\approx$ 0.8 or higher).

** 30 Aug 2013

I've been making too many mistakes

-  Runs with oceanM.*.allsp are not what I wanted them to be because
   they didn't have sponges on the western edge and had a sponge over
   the shelf. all runns-test*/ are affected.

-  I'm having trouble with high velocities (0.3 m/s) appearing in the
   eastern sponge /occasionally./ I'm not sure yet whether I should
   care. runew-02-bg/ had this trouble but also had barotropic Courant
   number > 1! Funnily, this appears at (300,22,02) very often. 300 is
   the eastern limit, (maybe 302), 22 is at shelfbreak and 02 is near
   surface. It could be noise associated with OBC being killed off but
   I'm not really sure. Reducing timestep to 60s seems to have removed
   this.

-  *Evening Update:* At dt=75s I don't see much trouble. FS field looks
   as clean as bathysouth-02/. Maybe I stick to this and continue?
   runew-02-bg-dt2/ has the run at 75s. I have just restarted the
   passive tracer field.

Essentially, I have runbathysouth-02/ which was using the old profile
but looked really clean - no extraneous waves roaming around domain
visible in FS before the eddy gets pretty close to topo. I'm having
trouble recreating this with the corrected eddy profile.

TODO: /Should do some btvel/ expts. tomorrow with e-w isobaths & mean
flow to check nuding parameters./ This will let me figure out whether
problem is with BC or is just the result of different eddy acting on the
background flow. I have a run at dt=75s going to check whether the
initial transient dies out just in case.

Ken has talked to Hyodae about me using the WHOI cluster. Must get that
set up soon.

** 18 Aug 2013

Here is the plan

-  First run Zhang eddy for EW isobaths - doing now

-  Then run Katsman eddy for EW isobaths - doing now

-  Run Katsman eddy for NS isobath - different beta values to test
   hypothesis

** 13 Aug 2013

I don't think background shear is the way to go. Values seem way off.

** 22 Jul 2013

topoeddy/runbathysouth-03-new: Proper analog for NS v/s EW isobath
comparision. Same res etc. See results.tex file for details.

** 17 Jul 2013

Shelfbreak run sbe-01 still does not work. T,S get to really high
values. Problem at downstream boundary = either sponge layer or OBC time
step problem.

*This is now known to be a sponge problem. dt=90s is too fast even for a
topoeddy run with closed boundaries.*

** 16 Jul 2013

Creating shelfbreak front with salinity requires some diffusivity I
think. - just found out that I had SCOEF = 0. Maybe it will work now.

Checking ltrans-compare run for runbathysouth-02/

1. comparing N with time looks good.

2. stats don't look that good. - error was that I was telling LTRANS
   histroy file had output at every 0.5 days but in reality, it was 0.66
   days or so. Much better now, centroid of z-location doesn't agree as
   well but that is to be expected?

3. Changed to calculating kurtosis using builtin MATLAB function. values
   are now reasonable.

Generally, the z-value disagrees more which is to be expected?

** 12 Jul 2013

Updated roms\_create script to make shelfbreak front in salinity. I have
sbe-01 running!

** 10 Jul 2013

I might have grid convergence at 750mx750m!

** 08 Jul 2013

Today I learnt that most of the 'streamer' I see in the passive tracer
field is due to advection by the eddy's core velocity field. This is
because the contour I obtain using Chelton's method demarcates a max. in
$\nabla$SSH which is generally where the peak velocity is. See .

[[images/pt-quiver.png]] [fig:ptquiv]

Update: passive tracer really does not look like it's catching the
streamer. The dye is sort of useless because it isn't getting reset. The
eddy modifies the downstream dye distribution and so when it moves past
the region it has affected, I really don't see much. I'll need to look
at some sort of difference field probably (anomalies w.r.t to initial
distribution?).

** 07 Jul 2013

I'm having trouble comparing LTRANS and ROMS floats for latest run, I
don't understand why. Lot of the ROMS floats didn't get deployed either.
I need to spend some time looking into that.

The Lagrangian label thing looks feasible, I need to decide whether I
want to use a dye or floats. To process floats, I'll need some sort of
distance metric to figure out 'radius of influence' of the eddy. Might
need the same with passive tracer.

Need to do some thinking about transport - I should be able to get an
Eulerian measure with the data I have. Can use the passive tracer to
divide into classes. Maybe this should be my first goal.

Using floats makes it a lot more complicated. I need to throw them out
once they cover 180 or 270 degrees of the eddy. I need to make code to
calculate $(r,θ)$ of float's position w.r.t eddy center. Alternatively,
just chuck everything past a certain point on the eddy contour.

** 04 Jul 2013

Abandoned concave hull approach - there doesn't seem to be much
literature on it. Instead I use two measures - solidity & rectangularity
to remove some false positives. See for more details.

** 03 Jul 2013

Passive tracer needs some diffusivity, ugh.

track\_eddy chokes on runbathysouth-02. I'm trying to check for minimum
anitpodal distance but it seems to be hard. First off, convex hulls
don't work, so I need to identify antipodal points for a concave polygon
/ hull.

** 02 Jul 2013

*Run:* Running into trouble when the secondary eddy hits the open
boundary. I think I need a stronger sponge later. Sponge layers need to
be updated for new setup too. Also, my eddy now moves eastwards after
collision with the shelf. I suspect it's due to the image effect
overpowering the background flow. Shelf is only 30 km wide now
(runbathysouth-02).

*Floats:* Need to fix ltrans\_create for z-axis. As of now, I've been
deploying floats only in the top 30m. Need to make a
roms\_floats\_create script. This will take some work but should be
useful. Not much progress on obtaining transport from floats.

** 26 Jun 2013

Started new run with a lot (!) more floats in better position. Also,
added one drifter in center of eddy to see what happens. Need to do
FLOATS\_STICKY and FLOATS\_VWALK. I need to rewrite the float stats code
to be more efficient at pair-wise statistics. Then, I can implement rest
of the stuff in \cite{LaCasce2008}.

Also, need to work on transport estimates and visualizing the streamer.
Also need to do volume conservation calc with drifters.

** 25 Jun 2013

Finally got LTRANS to work. I need to set the angle variable in my
roms\_create script. Made that change. I've manually set angle = 0 in
the LTRANS code. Coded in a lot of drifter statistics from
\cite{LaCasce2008}. Agreement is good in generally but screwy at the
end. That's because in the beginning my floats are far away from the
action. Also, for some reason LTRANS floats die near the end. Need to
figure out why.

ltrans\_create script is working. My floats are deployed at pretty much
the same place (errors   mm) but time of deployment is off by 0.08 -
0.25 days. Need to fix that.

For my next run, I'll need to do a lot more floats in more interesting
places.

** 23 Jun 2013

1.5x1.5 km run results in slightly different track. I think I'll run 1km
x 1km further away from the southern boundary.

TRACMASS with $Ω$ instead of $w$ seems to behave better with vertical
velocities but still not great.

** 21 Jun 2013

Glenn has made some good suggestions about making sure that my grid
cells are square-ish. I'm now doing a 1.5km x 1.5km run. Also setting up
floats and outputting omega for use in tracmass.

I need to check if using omega improves vertical behaviour in tracmass.

** 18 Jun 2013

Might be interesting to look at CTW solutions to this configuration.
Maybe I'm not resolving cross-shore wavelength. Seems unlikely but worth
a try.

Making $β$ small doesn't really help. I'll need a bigger domain to be
sure but it looks like the eddy is still pushed away from the shelf.

John Allen's inertial jet idea won't work because the width of the jet
depends on the value of $β$.

I'm doing a 300m run now, hopefully it converges.

** 17 Jun 2013

Should add Gordon notes.

*Problem summary*

-  Meridional mean flow = Right now, I'm trying reducing $β$ by an order
   of magnitude = I'll need a longer domain.

-  Grid convergence

** 29 May 2013

750m resolution also shows slightly different behaviour. This is weird.
See results.tex for more details.

** 24 May 2013

AAARHH! 500m resolution run (runteb-04-hires-3) shows different
behaviour. The eddy seems to get 'stuck' near the shelfbreak and then
slowly moves offshore. There seems to be a cyclone formed south of it
that causes this behaviour. I'm redoing the run with the eddy starting
farther north hoping that the earlier result was a boundary effect.

** 22 May 2013

I've been doing runs looking at the influence of resolution.
(runteb-04-XXXX). Funnily, if I go down to 1km res in the $x$-direction
(cross-isobath), the eddy tends to stick near the shelf. Running one at
500m resolution to check now.

\cite{Flagg2006} mentions a Navy database of WCRs and GS frontal
positions. Their fig. 2 show that WCR centers tend to be between the
2000 & 3000 m isobaths. Tracking this database down has been futile so
far.

** 13 May 2013

Synthesized what I have now in the topoeddy section in results.tex.
$β_t$ might be a better parameter to look at rather than eddy dia /
slope width since that takes into account total water depth. Waiting for
ken's input now. I've started run teb-07 with much wider slope to see
what happens.

** 10,11 May 2013

With wider slope, eddies seem to hang around shelf after impact
(runteb-03,04). Most post-impact behaviour is explainable by considering
the effect of the secondary cyclone \citep{Sutyrin2010}. This is unlike
what I saw in the first run (teb-02) where the eddy bounced back.

[htbp]

cccc Run & Shelf Width (km) & Slope Width (km) & Slope 'slope'
teb-02 & 30 & 20 & 0.05
teb-03 & 20 & 50 & 0.02
teb-04 & 20 & 50 & 0.05
teb-05 & 20 & 30 & 0.05
teb-06 & 50 & 30 & 0.05

[tab:teb]

I don't think the dynamics depends on the slope variation
(\cite{Sutyrin2010} agrees with this - they report that behaviour
doesn't change much with slope). What I need to resolve is which ratio
the dynamics cares about
$$\frac{\text{eddy diameter}}{\text{slope width}} \qquad \text{OR} \qquad \frac{\text{eddy diameter}}{\text{distance to coastal wall}}$$

I don't think it is possible to have a steady state meridional flow on a
$β$ plane.

** 08 May 2013

On a $β$ plane with no background flow (run teb-02 - closed boundaries),
the eddy bounces back away from the shelf. This is not what
\cite{Hyun2008,Sutyrin2010,Itoh2001} saw.

\cite{Hyun2008} use a topographic beta that is an order of magnitude
smaller than mine and a much wider slope.

\cite{Itoh2001} use a wider slope too but slope magnitude is similar to
mine.

My new run (teb-03) has a smaller & wider slope (0.02 v/s 0.05; 50 km
v/s 20 km). YES! this works more like expected. Eddy hangs around
shelfbreak and moves southwards, like in \cite{Sutyrin2010}.

I also have btvel runs looking at what happens to the inflow on a $β$
plane.

** 06 May 2013

Just found out that all my runs are on a $f$-plane. $β$ plane runs don't
behave the way I expect them to.

1. Eddy-boundary interaction? - move eddy southwards = does not work.

2. Barotropic flow over slope on beta plane? - I did one topo+eddy expt
   on beta plane = doesn't behave too weirdly.

3. nudging problem? Nudging zeta also at 10 days doesn't help and halved
   timestep.

4. Maybe try f-plane zeta solution with beta plane. - does not work

Some of the issue is definitely related to the inflow adjusting.

** 05 May 2013

T\_PASSIVE doesn't work because it's having trouble reading the boundary
conditions file.

TRACMASS terminates trajectories early for some reason and there doesn't
seem to be any timestepping happening

Spent most of the day understanding TRACMASS code. Stil haven't figured
out why trajectories are being terminated. Setting kriva appropriately
now gives me output at model timesteps. It looks like it's reading only
the first timestep of velocities.

** 01 May 2013

LTRANS still moves particles westwards.

I've managed to compile TRACMASS but it isn't creating any particles
yet. There might be a problem with wflux calculations.

ROMS T\_PASSIVE + FLOATS doesn't seem to work. It segfaults. Must do a
debug compile to see what's wrong.

*** 29 Apr 2013

VISC4 + open boundaries doesn't work. Not even with split scheme.

Now I'm going to compare ROMS float tracks with LTRANS outputs (1 day
avg, 6 hour his).

*** 16 Apr 2013

Running tests to figure out visc4 value. So far, visc4 = 1e7,1e8 work.
*1e6 does not work.* I'm setting tnu4 = 0 since my tracer advection
schemes were 4th order earlier too (tnu2 = 0).

I'm having better luck with LTRANS but there seems to be a general
westward drift for most of the particles.

I'm having trouble visualizing ROMS output in other software. VAPOR
seems to expect lat/lon input.

*** 09 Apr 2013

runeddy-03-1his/ behaves better than the earlier 2. I've used RadNud on
T,S instead of plain Rad. Less junk comes in but there's still some
suspicious variability.

Some ideas

-  I could use ParaView / VisIt / VAPOR etc. to visualize the shelf
   water flow. This would mean that I don't have to do additional runs,
   at least initially.

-  I need some way to compare the results of 3rd, split and 4th order
   schemes. No idea what this should be now. The biggest difference will
   be numerical mixing. Maybe a T/S census would be the best way of
   checking this. I should ask Amala of what's appropriate for high
   resolution mesoscale simulations.

*** 08 Apr 2013

Just noticed that runeddy-01,02-1his have noise coming in from open
boundaries. I think I have two options to control this

1. RadNud on T,S instead of plain Rad

2. Try the 4th order scheme with biharmonic viscosity

*** 05 Apr 2013

Did some more work on the eddy tracking problem. Now, I save the
location of the FS maximum that's closest to shelbreak. I think this
makes more sense as a definition of a center for my purposes at least.
Works better than weighted center when the eddy splits into two.

*** 04 Apr 2013

Some eddy tracking problems. Here are some ideas on how to fix it

-  Use the Obuko-Weiss parameter as an additional criterion - Not sure
   how much sense this makes given the \cite{Beron-Vera2013} paper.-
   Meh. This is good at identifying the core in solid body rotation.

-  Subtract out background FS slope. - Seems to help a bit.

Run eddy-01 seems to split into two eddies after some time. When the
second eddy reaches the outflow boundary, there seems to be some crazy
adjustment in zeta. - rapid adjustment indicates barotropic waves
probably.

*** 02 Apr 2013

I've fixed the bug with zeta calculation for the solid body profile.
There is still some initial adjustment. This might not be fixable. Minor
bugs with eddy tracking code were also fixed.

*** 22 Mar 2013

Implemented \cite{Chelton2011} tracking method. Seems to work reasonably
well with some adjustments to thresholds. \cite{Beron-Vera2013} claims
that these Eulerian methods (Obuko-Weiss & SSH contour) don't work very
well. They argue for a more complicated 'geodesic eddy detection'
approach that apparently preserves material boundaries. Their definition
of an eddy seems more appropriate when considering questions of material
transport. I should keep this in mind when looking at entrainment
etc. later.

*** 19 Mar 2013

Solid body profile problem is a viscosity issue. I'd changed to a 4th
order scheme that has a lot less numerical dissipation than the default
3rd order advection scheme. Turns out the 3rd order scheme has a lot of
implicit numerical diffusion. *I still need to resolve the continuity
problem for the free surface calculation (solid body rotation profile)*

Currently, I'm trying to find appropriate timestep for the inflow
boundary with the front and am having trouble with that.

I've implemented a rough version of \cite{Chelton2011} eddy
identification procedure. I'll need to add the tracking and support for
multiple eddies soon.

*** 13 Mar 2013

Eddies with core in solid body rotation seem to be unstable on both $f$
and $β$ planes. The velocity and temperature fields get start getting
destroyed in 3 days.

Cyclostrophic balance is not required for WCRs at least - see
\cite{Olson1991}. The basic issue seems to be that I need to fix a limit
on the eddies I will look at. $\Ro < -0.25$, defined using the
geostrophic velocity (i.e., the limit of radient wind applicability)
seems to be a good one. Must check this with Ken.

*** 12 Mar 2013

Coded in solid body rotating eddies like in \cite{Katsman2003}. Seems to
work decently with gradient wind balanced velocity field. There is some
trouble with free surface height. I had to some adjustments to get the
FS field to match at the boundary. Some adjustment is seen in the
beginning but much less than that seen in the geostrophic balanced
eddies.

I should talk to Glenn about getting cyclostrophic balance to work. I'll
need to it for fast eddies. Ring 82-B, for instance, had a max. velocity
of .

SSH calculation is known to work well since it is the same for
geostrophic and gradient wind balance. Since the gradient wind code
works well, I assume my SSH calculation is right. Thus, the velocity
field must be wrong but it's so simple!

*** 09 Mar 2013

Added vertical half-Gaussian structure for eddy.

*** 06 Mar 2013

Gradient wind works very well! However, it looks like I need
cyclostrophic balance for larger $\Ro$ eddies. I'm having trouble
implementing this. Interestingly, the SSH field is the same regardless
of what balance you use (geostrophic / gradient wind / cyclostrophic). I
think this is because you only integrate the density field to get the
SSH.

*** 05 Mar 2013

I've implemented gradient wind balance for the eddy velocity field. It
still needs to be tested. I suspect the recent trouble I've been having
with rapidly adjusting eddy fields is due to strong gradients imposed in
the eddy. Really not sure though. The problem is almost certainly with
the initial condition, NOT the .in file or the model options.

Here are the remaining things I need to solve

1. Implement DJ\_GRADPS in MATLAB. At the very least, I should use
   manu's version of WJ\_GRADPS and see if that improves the initial
   condition.

2. Implement Chelton's eddy tracking algorithm. This will be useful to
   actually figuring out whether the eddy hits the shelfbreak etc.

3. Use the split schemes to see if spurious diapycnal mixing is what is
   causing cooling in my domain. How do I diagnose this cooling?

4. Try nudging on 3D v inflow instead of 2D barotropic with the
   shelfbreak current and see if there's any improvement.

5. Figure out optimum timestep that does not give me trouble at the
   inflow boundary.

6. I need to write setup parameters to the initial conditions netCDF
   file so that there is a permanent record. Also need a script that
   will read these parameters for each project and print them out.

The runs I need to do are

1. Eddy + topo and see how close different eddies get to topo using
   Chelton algorithm. Also, check gradient wind balance and see if
   adjustment is better.

2. sbreak only runs to find out what timestep works best with inflow BC.
   Also, test out improved pressure gradient calculation & try split
   schemes.

*** 01 Mar 2013

Two things to do next week:

1. Run front only simulation and figure out which timestep works best
   for dx=1 km & dy=1.5km.

2. Test different advection schemes / vertical stretching params to see
   whether apparent cooling depends on that. Some T-S diagram diagnostic
   might help.

3. Run eddy + topo simulation to see if beta does indeed move eddy all
   the way near topography.

*** 27 Feb 2013

Running simulation with front + eddy + shelfbreak. $dt=\SI{150}{s}$
doesn't work. Crap is introduced at the upper boundary and high
frequency variability at the lower boundary too. I see waves coming that
I didn't see with a higher res simulation (sbe-01). I'm trying with
$dt=\SI{120}{s}$ now. In a higher resolution simulation, I saw local
waves / eddies being formed at the front that is in the vicinity of the
eddy.

I think I should first fix the upper boudnary problem and then see if
there are lower boudnary problems. If so, I could try a stronger sponge
there.

*** 26 Feb 2013 - Sponge layer

I've inserted a sponge layer near outflow boundary hoping to control the
noise. This seems to work pretty well. Changing downstream BCs from Gra
(sb-15) to Rad (sb-16) results in some noise near boundary. I'm now
increasing strength of sponge layer with Rad conditions (sb-17). Using
Rad BCs results in noise near outflow boundary. Gra behaves better but
is it justifiable to have no tracer flux out of an open boundary? Gra
should be for boundary far away from dynamics of interest so maybe it
is.

Momentum-only sponge? Doesn't work. see runsb-20.

/Tools:/ Troubles with vertical *and* horizontal gradient calculation.
Increasing number of vertical grid points does not really change
gradient calculation error. Increasing number of horizontal points shows
bad behaviour just offshore of shelfbreak. Higher error (35%) but more
localized compared to earlier (14%).

I suspect that all this gradient calculation trouble is similar to the
spurious PGF error and that I'll need to implement fancier schemes to
get rid of the artifacts.

*** 25 Feb 2013

Today's lesson is that BCs that work with flat bottom configurations
don't do as well with a bottom slope.

There seems to be initial adjustment and radiation of internal waves
away from the front. This generally finishes in 10 days. Probably
shouldn't worry about it though it would be nice if I could have a
cleaner initialization.

*** 22 Feb 2013 - Shelfbreak front experiments

I'm having trouble with the lower boundary - lots of high frequency
noise propagates in.

/Thermal wind balance:/ With flat bottom max. error is 0.6%, adding a
slope gets it to as high 15% (at depth). Free surface calculation agrees
very well in both cases. I now think that the problem is in my
diff\_cgrid.m code that calculates horizontal derivatives on a stretched
grid. Calculating a velocity field using the output of that code for
$T_x$ gives a very crappy result. Also, comparing that output to my
specified $T_x$ results in 15% error near the shelfbreak and smaller
errors over the slope i.e., my diagnostics are wrong, the field is
probably balanced pretty well.

*** 31 Jan 2013

Gah, my front is vertical and I need more horizontal resolution to
resolve instabilities. First step is to make front vertical, rotate
isobaths by 90 d, increase resolution and decrease domain size. Ken says
most coastal fronts are about wide. Might have to move to a horizontal
stretched grid later.

*Frontal slope v/s isopycnal slope:* Frontal slope is the slope of the
/density gradient/. When you have observations, generally you need to
guess an isopycnal that behaves like a front and use it's slope.

*** 30 Jan 2013

I finally have code that makes a shelfbreak front that is generic in
terms of where in the domain (N/S/E/W) I want it. Now, I need to see
whether I can maintain it. For now, I'm assuming that ROMS applies an
inflow with T,S properties based on boundary values which should work
fine.

These runs are for straight isobaths.

*** 17 Jan 2013 - Post proposal

The following is feedback from proposal meeting.

-  Somehow make isobaths straight. Two options here:

   -  background flow at an angle to isobaths

   -  slope in x and use β to move eddy towards it.

-  Need to experiment with creating and maintaining a shelfbreak front.

-  Need to figure out method to calculate streamer fluxes : key question
   being - how do I identify the streamer?

*** 17 Jan 2013 - Post proposal

*runte-05-rst* is best till date

I have a decently working setup now: I use VOLCONS to enforce mass
conservation. I let the background flow adjust to the inflow and make
sure that impact does not happen until much after the flow has adjusted.
People seem happy with it. The main issue is to get to straight
isobaths. Weird topography () can introduce more scales, modify
shelfbreak front instability and make maintaining the front hard.

Boundary conditions

-  west (outflow) : FS = Cha, T,S = Gra, everything else = Rad

-  east (inflow) : ubar = RadNud, everything else = Rad

[[images/simxy.png]] [fig:topo_{o}ld]

*** 20 Dec 2012

-  After lots of attempts with spinup, for some reason the ubar,vbar
   fields get advected away from the eddy. this is totally weird.

-  Best option might be to let the fields run prognostically without the
   eddy and then insert the eddy into that. Or, use the coast in $x$ and
   let $β$ move the eddy towards the coast.

-  Prognostic runs without VOLCONS seem to drain out.

-  Changing topography to new improved bathy2.m script has resulted in
   cleaner flow over shelf.

*** 05 Dec 2012

-  I now understand why VOLCONS on both boundaries are needed. Added
   funda to roms.tex. Thinking about fixing it in the ROMS code itself
   or maybe asking John Wilkin for his fixed version?

-  There seems to be no way to suppress the adjustment at the
   boundaries. It does *not* depend on nudging timescale, timestep
   length. A sponge layer at the downstream boundary might help, but not
   sure if i want it with a cross basin flow.

*** 03 Dec 2012

-  As of now, best results are with VolCons turned on but neither Ken
   nor I think that's the best way to do it. Consequences for advection
   velocity are unknown. I should diagnose the eddy's transalation
   velocity.

-  All runs till now have no topography and start with a geostrophically
   balanced initial state. Ken suggested trying a gradient balance and
   seeing if that resulted in smaller adjustment at the beginning.

* Things to check in model

\cite{Chen2011} shows a patch of high salinity water left behind near
the isobath as the ring moves away.

\cite{Tang1985} sees substrace intrusions that are *not* streamers. They
hypothesize some double diffusive instability.

\cite{Churchill1985} notes that saline intrusions over the pycnocline
tend to persist for periods of 2 weeks implying low vertical mixing.

In this respect, \cite{Ramp1983} points out that *The front may be moved
offshore into a region where the bottom slope does not stabilize the
baroclinic instability of the front. *

Also, \cite{Wei2008}

** Interaction of eddies and shelfbreak front

\citep{Chen2011,Gawarkiewicz2001,Pickart1999,Halliwell1979}

\cite{Chen2011}'s modelling studies seems similar stuff as was reported
in \cite{Gawarkiewicz2001} about the front steepening .... But, he
observes wavelength waves propagating down the front unlike
\cite{Ramp1983} who noted a λ of , propagating at .

\cite{Halliwell1979} see pertrubations of cross-shelf amplitude $\sim$
with an alongshore λ = and a south-westward propagation speed of .
Generally, more eddies tend to interact with the front off George's
Bank. They spin down and weaken as they move SW along the shelfbreak.

** Ring motion and evolution over a slope

\citep{Smith1983,Itoh2001,McWilliams1979,Hyun2008}

On a β plane, there are initial dispersion tendencies which make the
ring not maintain it's circular shapes. This is because long dispersive
Rossby waves propagate fastest resulting in weakened gradients at the
western edge and sharper gradients at the eastern edge. This leads to a
meridional self-advection tendency - northward for cyclones & southward
for anti-cyclones. This non-linear tendency results due to the asymmetry
which can be induced by other factors, not just β.

A non-linear eddy = balance b/w advection and Rossby wave dispersion
(for scales less than deformation radius).

Deep compensation in baroclinic eddies since topographic Rossby waves
are bottom intensified and radiate away over a slope. [Relate this to
vertical mode theory in a linearly stratified, sloping bottom ocean.]
Nonlinear modal coupling is necessary for compensaed structure to be
maintained. In a linear system, the barotropic and barolcinic components
would disperse and there would be no coherent feature
\citep{McWilliams1979}.

The resultant of planetary β and topgraphic $β_T$ is will determine
which way dispersion driven non-linear self advection will act. Turns
out, cyclones want to move onshore while anti-cyclones want to move
offshore.

As the eddy moves over topography, two cyclones are formed, one is the
wake eddy that is modified by NL propagation and the other probably
results from forward radiation of topographic Rossby waves -
\cite{Ramp1986}.

Effects of non-linearity are threefold \citep{McWilliams1979}, - list
from \cite{Cornillon1989}

-  Westward translational velocity is increased.

-  Dispersive decay is reduced

-  Southward translation for anticyclonic eddies

The forces that act on a eddy are

-  β force: Asymmetry in coriolis force results in meridional motion.

-  Rocket effect: seen in ring-wall interactions. Leakage of mass
   southwards → northward motion. *When does the slope-wall transition
   happen?* \cite{Itoh2001} use a min. depth of .

\cite{Itoh2001} see that barotropic velocity is radiated away in a 100
days. JEBAR (joint effect of baroclinicity and bottom relief) apparently
helps maintain deep flow structure in one case. They see general
westward propagation $\perp$ to isobath, unlike what \cite{Smith1983}
claim i.e, offshore movement due to NL effect.

\cite{LaCasce1998} says that \cite{Smith1983} hypothesis is wrong over
strong slopes. Interaction of vortex with topography depends on a
"effective" slope ($ε_2 = β_2 L^2/U_2$, 2 - layer two) that depends on
slope, stratification and length/velocity scales of the vortex. Self
induced translation over topography only occurs when vortex is
significantly barotropic, larger than deformation radius and slope is
weak. Else, the lower layer velocity field is radiated away and you're
left with a surface trapped vortex that doesn't feel the bottom.
Caveats: 2 layer, non-linear QG, infinite slope. Essentially, if the
vortex maps onto a topographic wave mode, that will radiate away and
you're left with a sum of surface trapped wave modes = surface
intensified vortex. After this, there is a possibility that the slope
can stabilize the resulting surface vortex. /Extension to continuous
stratification/ results in one parameter
$$\left(\frac{f^2 L^2}{N^2H^2}\right) \frac{U}{β_2L^2} = \frac{f}{αN} \frac{U}{NH}$$.
I'm not sure how this works but essentially it's like the inverse of
effective slope. WCRs are in the strong effective slope regime which
means they must radiate off some energy as topographic waves. Later
evolution is unclear.

/Extension to β-plane:/ two layer model - you get two limits. For
$β_2\gg β$, there are 2 modes: one is the topographic wave with 0
surface signature and the other is a 1.5 layer Rossby wave. Conclusion
is that once the topographic wave radiates away, the vortex then behaves
as a 1.5 layer vortex as studied in \cite{McWilliams1979} , and not
stationary as in results of \cite{LaCasce1996}.

\cite{Hyun2008} show that an eddy can cross isobaths and get onto the
shelf (see figures 12,13,14). During this, it is eroded significantly in
the vertical. They also see two cyclones formed to the N/S of the eddy.
The southern one is due to collision like in \cite{Oey2004} and the
northern one is due to topographic Rossby wave radiation.

\cite{Shaw1991} look at adjustment of a ring over the slope. They start
with the ring over the slope. They claim that it is /not/ the vorticity
anomaly associated with the ring, but the nonlinear advection of density
near the bottom that forces the topographic Rossby waves.

*** Baroclinic eddies near slope / coastal topo

\citep{Sutyrin2001,Dunn2001,Sutyrin2003}

\cite{Sutyrin2003} says that a wider slope will delay onset of image
effect dynamics. However, in his case, the eddy crosses the shelfbreak!

*** Baroclinic dipoles near a vertical wall

\cite{Dewar2010,Dewar2011}

For the anticyclonic half, there is a section of the wall where vortex
velocity will arrest the Kelvin wave mode leading to hydraulic control.
This is where strong cyclonic vorticity is generated at the wall for
anticyclonic vortices. Should explain what I see in =runew-06-fb-sp40=.

There is a low pressure anomaly that is generated between the
anticyclone and the seamount at the point of impact.

** Rossby Wave Radiation

\citep{Flierl1984a, McDonald1998a}

** Offshore Transport

** Vortex Motion in Shear

\citep{Oruba2012,Oruba2013}

*Summary: *Background shear is /not/ like $β$. The sheared background
velocity field should be able to stretch / elongate the vortex in such a
manner that the secondary cyclone is intensified, resulting in greater
meridional motion. This happens when vortex is embedded in sheared flow
of opposite sign vorticity since rotational effects tend to cancel and
deformation term dominates. Need Okubo-Weiss parameter > 0 for
deformation to dominate. I will need shear such that $\bar{u}$ is
stronger at southern coast and weaker at northern deep wall.

*Email to ken:*

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  On further study, the stuff that Amala & Jean-Baptiste were talking
  about is not related to background shear acting like beta. The
  background shear can deform the vortex such that it tends to form a
  stronger secondary cyclone. This happens when the Rossby wave
  radiation from the vortex amplifies the cyclone formed by the vortex
  advecting water parcels (and causing vorticity anomalies). This
  stronger secondary cyclone (relative to axisymmetric vortex case) then
  cause greater meridional motion compared to the axisymmetric case.

  See Fig. 2 in \cite{Oruba2012}. They do their experiments with a
  cyclone. Fig. 2 shows how the elongation of a vortex into a more
  ellipsoidal feature can result in greater meridional motion. There is
  no background shear in that. They specify the ellipsoidal profile
  analytically to show the effect elongation can have. Fig. 6 shows the
  effect of cyclonic and anticyclonic background shear on a cyclone. The
  latter results in deformation and greater northward motion.

Ken is concerned that the counter-rotating ring outside the main PV
anomaly is an artifact due to OA processing in AVISO data. However

water comes from offshore of the isobath. But where is the shelf water
coming from ? Streamer in Event 1 eventually gets "squashed" between WCR
and Gulf Stream and mixes away. Event 1 lasted 14 days. Source of
streamer was well behind ring.

** Eddy stability

They study axisymmetric rings in a N-layer shallow water model. Find
that compensated vortices are least unstable. This is probably the best
reference for this stability stuff.

Argh. The stability of realistic rings is still unexplained. They argue
that Gaussian rings are not actually special contradicting .

counter-rotating = deep flow in opposite sense = unstable
Compensated = no deep flow = less unstable w.r.t counter-rotating.
Co-rotating = deep flow in same sense = stable in normal mode sense.

/How deep is "deep flow"?/

The Gaussian profile seems to be special. So they use $e^{-r^3}$ profile
with decay length scale of + velocities from cyclostrophic balance.
Vortices with a strong barotropic component tend to become a monopole
after nonlinear evolution.

/What is the time scale for this nonlinear evolution?/

2 layer, QG, β = 0.

Increase steepness of slope increases rate of dispersion of the deep

** Eddy-topography interaction

\cite{Chapman1987} show that for an invariant translating eddy, the
eddy's flow field is modified based on the distance to the slope
relative to the first mode deformation radius. Essentially, the scale of
the response is limited to a region within a deformation radius of the
forcing in the deep ocean. So, when the forcing is near a slope (near in
the sense of being within a deformation radius), the ring interacts with
topography and the flow pattern is modified near the bottom.

Use a compensated (constant $T$ below ) Gaussian geostrophic eddy and
study ring trajectory and flow adjustment after impact. They see the
bottom-intensified southward jet (CTW dirn., wide and at a depth of )
and formation of cyclones like in .

In simulations with just a wall, the eddy bounces off and moves
northward (opposite to CTW dirn). No cyclones / anti-cyclones are
produced. This is probably because there is no stretching / compression
involved with water parcels moving offshore (explanation in ).

For simulations with a shelfbreak, a cyclone-anticyclone pair is formed.
The cyclone contains shelf water (cold) and should be associated with
upwelling.

Ken's comments:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It looks to me like the main result is the bottom-trapped jet, just
  like in Kelly and Chapman. I noticed that Oey did not mention that
  paper somehow.

  For our purposes, though, they do manage to get an eddy, but there is
  some question as to how long it remains stable before it falls apart.
  It would be nice to have an eddy that holds together for 10s of days.
  This may have a lot to do with the initial temperature field.
#+END_QUOTE

Subsurface and bottom intensified cyclone adn along-shore jet (in the
sense of CTW) are formed. The jet agrees with linear predictions from .
There is flow convergence over the shelfbreak and relatively weak
/downwelling/ in the inviscid case. Presence of BBL results in upwelling
$\sim \mO(\SI{30}{\m\per\day})$. This is due to flow convergence at the
hydraulic jump? Tracer goes up to $z= \SI{-200}{\m}$. There is some
upward propagation of the jet.

Lab expts of interaction of vortex /baroclinically stable/ shelfbreak
current. Use paramter ε (max. azmimuthal velocity in vortex to speed of
shelfbreak current). Tries to quantify deflection of shelfbreak current
due to interactions. Obtains results that agree well with observations.

/Width of the shelfbreak current is less than $L_d$ - so it is
baroclinically stable. In practice, there are some small amplitude
meanders./ 1½ layer stratification, technically sloping bottom doesn't
do proper β in stratified fluids plus in this model, only the lower
layer feels 'β'. But coupling of motion across interface makes vortex
moves 'westwards' i.e., towards the current. Water is introduced through
a circular source for the time it takes to fill up the shelf. There is a
current at the interface (1½ layer).

Finds that there are weak (ε < 1) and strong (ε > 1) interactions. For
weak interactions, fluid is pulled from the vortex and joins the outer
part of the shelfbreak current. Offshore transport is small (20% of
geostrophic shelfbreak transport).

The strong interactions result in streamers and permanent loss of shelf
water. Some vortex fluid also makes it onto the shelf. At ε $\sim$ 1,
water is drawn from offshore of the shelfbreak velocity maximum. but for
large ε, water is drawn from the shelf.

Does barotropic primitive equation model simulations. Looks at lot of
the things I was thinking about. No offshore transport of slope water
with linearized equations (pg. 106).

Sees that eddy disperses over shelf and self advects outside.

He defines 'encounter time' as time taken to form first topographic
eddy. Total transport is defined as volume that is taken off shelf in
this encounter time. He finds that total transport is weakly sensitive
to velocity of eddy and distance b/w eddy and slope. Composition /
source of water extracted is very different though.

*Caveats:* Two layer, topo can penetrate upper layer, $f$-plane, eddy
initialized over slope.

-  Anticyclone is always pushed away - presumably due to cyclone that
   spins out. This 'net drift' as she calls it, is bigger for the larger
   of two eddies with same PV anomaly and is also larger for stronger
   (PV anomaly) of two eddies with same size. (Sec. 3.3.4)

-  Main conclusion is that there are 2 mechanisms: eddy advection -
   resulting in streamer + wave induced mechanism. The former is
   localized in space & time and the latter acts in a distributed manner
   - spreading in dirn. of CTW. The bay shaped coastline enhances the
   wave effect near the eastern boundary in her setup. Point is that
   these waves need to intensify non-linearly resulting in cross-isobath
   transport.

-  For anticyclone interactions, the eddy advection field opposes the
   direction of CTW, resulting in some sort of balance / 'resonance' and
   there's much stronger offshore advection - resulting in the formation
   of a strong eddy. This is very apparent in the barotropic case. *What
   about baroclinic?* Note that this 'balance' effect will occur for any
   coastline orientation.

-  In the /baroclinic/ system, the eddy's advection influence is
   restricted to internal deformation radius = decreased importance of
   advection and increased importance of wave mechanism. This means that
   the wave mechanism is more important near the shelfbreak since
   advection's effectiveness drops off with distance. /Also means that
   we care about how close the eddy gets./

-  Comparing bay-coastline (B1) & straight coastline (B2) - both
   baroclinic - B2 > B1 in net transport but comparing latitude where
   bay is open = B1 > B2 presumably due to wave intensification near
   eastern boundary (See fig. 3.16).

-  *Advection Mechanism:* Magnitude of swirl velocity over the slope
   determines the strength of secondary cyclone, anticyclone's effective
   range as well as cross-isobath transport = /we should care about how
   close the eddy gets!/ Closer anticyclone = stronger secondary cyclone
   + shorter spinup time for secondary cyclone.

-  *Wave mechanism:* Vary slope profiles in upper and lower layer.
   Varying upper layer slope involves changing depth of shelf. Hmmm....
   - but other wise, deeper shelf + lower slope in upper layer = more
   transport = makes sense. Points out that you need think of cyclonic
   vorticity in streamer (cyclone?) having a local effect - opposes
   advection by eddy = parameter $\Delta U/ β_T L^2 \ge 1$ (sec. 3.3.5);

-  Changing /lower layer slope:/ Everything same till cyclones get off
   slope → narrower slope = stronger cyclone + weaker anticyclone.
   Differences in interaction occur after the cyclones get off slope and
   pair with the forcing anticyclone. As the anticyclone drifts away
   (due to secondary cyclone), it's motion induces lower layer vorticity
   anomalies which can then either disperse as waves or form lower layer
   eddies. Wide slope = lower layer dominated by topographic waves :
   narrow slope = lower layer dominated by eddies. The eddies induced
   greater drift away from slope. To conclude, wide slope = lower layer
   dominated by waves = ring stays near slope = greater transport (and
   vice versa).

Questions:

-  How might mean flow in CTW dirn. affect the balance between the two
   mechanisms seen in the anticyclonic interaction case?

*** Vortex-Ridge / Seamount interactions

One-layer 2D barotropic model with rigid-lid.

2-layer numerical experiments.

Lab experiments. Also, 2D.

** WCR Characteristics

It seems that they're assuming that if a vortex is spinning up
($\Delta\text{PV} > 0$ in their terminology), it must entrain fluid and
become bigger to remain stable. I think the main problem is the 2D
assumption as that effectively prevents vortex stretching from
happening.

** Observations

They note that WCR translation is primarily due to advection by /upper
level flow field/ from observations.

Transport offshore $\sim$ . Warm streamer intrusion of size . Speed over
bank $\sim \SI{0.2}{\m/\s}$. Strong currents $\sim \SI{0.5}{\m/\s}$
extend to about depth.

Eddy is off shelfbreak?

3 rings per year are found nearby but are not entraining all the time.
Conclude that 0.3 to 2 rings are effectively transporting stuff offshore
every year.

Use $S \le 34$ psu to identify shelf water. Says that streamers draw
water from approximately 100m depth.

Qualitative treatment of WCR entrainment. They describe frontal waves
possibly generated by interaction of the WCR with the current. These
waves were seen to move in a direction opposite to that expected by
previous results. No idea why.

Scotian Shelf Water (SSW) is cold and nutrient rich and it's intrusion
over the bank seems to be important.

Enhanced chlorophyll coincided with locally cold surface waters →
upwelling / vertical mixing (shear / breaking waves).
