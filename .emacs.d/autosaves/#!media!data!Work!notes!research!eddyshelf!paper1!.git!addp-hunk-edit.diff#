-Applying this scaling to the model output requires the diagnosis of a point in the eddy's trajectory where its cross-isobath translation velocity has been considerably reduced i.e., this isobath is where angular momentum and form stress are of similar magnitude. The hyperbolic tangent fit described in Section [[sec:trackdesc]] is used to locate this point (indicated by crosses in Figure [[fig:centrack]]). Figure [[fig:penerf]] shows the scaling in ([[eq:erfparam]]). The $y$ axis is the LHS of ([[eq:erfparam]]) calculated using $H$ at the locations marked by crosses in [[fig:centrack]]. The error bars indicated _scatter_ calculated using the RMSE of the fit, ([[eq:tanhfit]]) -- an error in diagnosed location, $δy$, results in an error in water depth, $δH$. The gray dashed line is a linear fit to these points (without accounting for the scatter). The agreement is reasonable and illustrates that the isolation constraint is a significant control on the evolution of the eddy. More direct evidence is seen when looking at the time evolution of the eddy's integrated potential and kinetic energies (Figure [[fig:energy]]) for a lot of eddies. The cross indicates the time, $t-t_\text{ref} = T$ i.e., the time at which the eddy is at the location marked by a cross in Figure [[fig:centrack]]. There is a sharp change in slope at this instant, showing a strong decrease in radiative energy loss from the eddy.


 
 #+NAME: fig:energy
 #+CAPTION: Integrated energy in the eddy as defined in ([[eq:edden]]). The cross marks the same time instant as the crosses in Figure [[fig:centrack]], i.e., the point at which cross-isobath translation is substantially reduced. This is at $t - t_\text{ref}=T$, where $T$ is defined using the $\tanh$ fit in [[eq:tanhfit]]
